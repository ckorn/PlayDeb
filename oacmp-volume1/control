Description: OpenArena Community Mappack Volume 1
 OpenArena Community Mappack (also called OACMP) is a mappack containing GPL'd
 maps made by the community itself. The idea is to give GPL servers something
 else to play aside of the official maps and the already GPLv2'd maps.
 .
 This idea started in the official OA forum. Anyone, as long as they respect
 the rules of the mappack, could be part of the DevTeam for this pack.
 They don't even need to be mappers, even if they can't produce assets, this
 doesn't mean that they can't test the maps themselves and give feedback.
 The style of the map was up to the mappers themselves, with the only important
 restriction being that everything must be GPLv2'd, like OA itself.
 .
 Over the course of more than a year, the OACMP Team worked very hard in this
 pack. The result is 13 high-quality maps made by 4 mappers and a plethora of
 contributors.
