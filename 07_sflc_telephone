Lead dev, quinton seems to agree with option 4.

? Does it seem like a reasonable license in your eyes?

? Any particular improvements you think of?

? What kind of scope does the ""

? Registration is unlikely in our case, is that something to take into consideration?

? Are there any other examples you could point at for licenses of this kind?

? Do you know anything of the trademark talks of gnome/sflc/debian? Should one wait for that?

? Debian uses a rather restrictive version?

Recompression only clause is very ambiguous, may require relicensing, needs removal.

"Substantially unmodified" is a useful buzzword.

Preferable to use sections like:
* permitted use
* non-permitted use

Separate trademark from copyright, maybe:
Source code
Object code
Images, logos (Possibly merged with above)
Trademark Policy (possibly in a separate document)
