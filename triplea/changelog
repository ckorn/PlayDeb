    memory if needed. (veqryn)
    * Created a new Unit Attachment option, "damageableAA", which allows this
    AA gun type unit to cause damage to a two hitpoint unit instead of
    outright killing it. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug where AA shots on 2 hitpoint units with Choose AA Casualties
    on was resulting in no damage or killed unit. Also changed battle display

    (veqryn)
    * Allowing custom AA hit and miss sounds for irregular AA types, with the
    folder being located at "battle_<typeaa>_hit" and "battle_<typeaa>_miss"

triplea (1.6.1.4-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * Adding dotted lines to the LOTR Middle Earth map, to show connections
    over rivers. (veqryn)
    * Not showing tech in stats panel if game xml does not have any
    technologies. (veqryn)
    * Created new stepProperty, "turnSummaryPlayers", which holds a list of
    players for whom we will include their turn summary information in the
    forum/email post. (veqryn)
    * Created new stepProperty, "skipPosting", which when true will skip the
    forum posting for that EndTurn type step. (veqryn)
    * Created new xml option type "stepProperty" for a step (gamePlay -
    sequence), which can hold small options for modifying a delegate step.
    (veqryn)
    * Adding some more sounds for ancient/classical era. (veqryn)
    * Adding some more ww2 sounds and national anthems for main players.
    (hepster)
    * Allowing air movement over neutrals and enemy territories so long as
    movement over neutrals is allowed, and no nonparatrooping units are
    present. (veqryn)
    * Creating caching mechanism for sound clips, so that there are never
    more than 24 sound clips being held in memory. This should prevent errors
    in MacOS and Linux, which can not handle having large number of sound
    clips open at same time. This may however result in a delay before
    hearing clips, and still could result in errors if clips are really long.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer error for a trigger based game property change of a
    field that starts out as null. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug in strategic bombing that allowed strategic bombing of units
    that can be damaged, which were also being transported. (veqryn)
    * Adding scroll bars to notification messages window. (veqryn)

    games. (veqryn)
    * Moved all sounds to a specific "era" folder (ww2, preindustrial,
    classical, future) and changing how sounds are found again, so that there
    should no longer be any need for duplicate sound files. Now all sounds
    should come with TripleA, and you can use the "sounds.properties" file to
    cherry pick which sounds you want. (veqryn)
    * Created a "sounds.properties" file which allows you to specify which
    era of sounds (ww2, preindustrial, classical, future) you are using, and
    also set up custom sound choices for each sound location path. (veqryn)
    * Getting TripleA Map Panel to center on the capital of a player,
    whenever we switch to a new player's phase. (veqryn)
    * Changing getBoundingRect and createTerritoryImage and getTiles so that
    any polygons on the right or bottom will be translated to be on the
    negative left or top, hopefully solving issue where the mini territory
    image was not being displayed properly for territories on both sides of a
    map divide. (frigoref) 
    * Abstracting the Stats panels into AbstractStatPanel so that extending
    Stats panel (and all of its overhead) is no longer necessary for the
    EconomyPanel, ObjectivePanel, TerritoryDetailPanel, and other panels.
    (veqryn)
    * Changing Tech Stats Panel to use small flag images for column headers
    instead of the first letter of nation names. (veqryn)
    * Fixing bugs with placing constructions in sea zones. Now constructions
    can only be "produced" by the territory they are going into. (veqryn)
    * Adding a lot more sounds to the engine (zim xero) and some sounds
    specific to napoleonic empires. (hepster & veqryn)
    * Added tutorial on how to make a map and/or map skin. (veqryn)
    * Allowing for Sea Factories, and Air Factories, to produce from owned
    sea zones. (veqryn)
    * Added UPnP support to TripleA, so that TripleA will now attempt to
    Forward Ports for the user.  This means users should no longer have to do
    port forwarding themselves to be able to host a game online. (veqryn)
    * Created framework for using UPnP library, and UI component for user.
    (veqryn)
    * Added java library for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to TripleA.
    (veqryn)
    * Created new HotKey, "N", which when pressed during a movement phase,
    will cycle through all units with available movement left, focusing the
    map on the unit. (veqryn)
    * Created new HotKey, "I", which when pressed will create a popup for 5
    seconds showing all the info about the unit and/or territory your mouse
    is currently over. (veqryn)
    * Allowing the map to be scrolled by using the arrow keys and/or WASD.
    (veqryn)
    * Added original owner, whenCapturedByGoesTo, captureUnitOnEnteringBy,
    and changeUnitOwners to the Territory tooltip and territory tab info.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixing Move Panel and Place Panel so that Undoing a move or place will
    not result in scrolling back to the top, and will instead scroll to make
    sure that the move under the undoed move is still visible. (veqryn)
    * Allowing all sounds to have a player associated with them.  Just name
    the sound "<soundName>_<playerName>".  If the player sound does not
    exist, it will use the default non-player sound. (veqryn)
    * Added a ton more new sounds to the engine. (veqryn)
    * Changed Sounds so that instead of specific sound files, the engine will
    search for specific sound folder. The engine will then randomly select a
    sound in that folder and play it. This allows for randomized sounds.
    (veqryn)

    text file. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug in Triggers that use "chance" and also have more than 1
    action or event inside them, so that they will no longer test once for

    should not be in the xml, only game logic should be. (veqryn)
    * Deleting xml property, "Display Units as Counters", and will replace it
    with a map.properties property "units.stack.size", because display
    options should not be in the xml, only game logic should be. (veqryn)
    * Created new "map.properties" variable "map.scrollWrapY", and got
    TripleA to successfully scroll in the Y direction, as well as both X and

    map skins. Also polishing up support for map skins that are totally
    different than the original map. (veqryn)
    * Creating new "map.properties" variables: "units.width", "units.height",
    "units.counter.offset.width" and "units.counter.offset.height", allowing
    maps to use non-standard sized unit images. (veqryn)

    * Fixing Concurrent Modification error with getIsAmphibiousMarine method
    in battle display. (veqryn)

    comparison contract. Also cleaned up a lot of code, fixed a lot of
    warnings. (veqryn)
    * Fixing bug history panel bug caused by loading a savegame at the end of
    the last player's turn, causing a "Can not add event, not in step" error
    to be thrown. (veqryn)
    * Adding new menu option "Focus On Own Casualties", which when selected
    will cause the default casualty selection to focused, allowing the user
    to hit spacebar to accept it. (hakon)
    * Changed order of steps so that in games where Submarines may submerge
    before battle, the attacker is asked first, then the defender is asked.
    (hakon)

    ping all computers once every minute, hopefully improving everyone's
    connections. (Sean Bridges & veqryn)
    * Allowing people to hold SHIFT down while their mouse is over a
    territory in order to keep that territory in the Territory Panel, no
    matter where they move their mouse afterwards. (frigoref)
    * Changed EndTurnDelegate so that Units Changing Ownership, and Hitpoint

    to one each. (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer for undoing a placement made by UK in global 1940
    maps, caused by the new no-air-checking delegate [players will need to
    update their 1940 maps though]. (veqryn)
    * Creating framework for TripleA to use proxies to connect to the
    internet. Allowing map downloading, PBEM/PBF, and dice servers to use a
    proxy. (veqryn)

triplea (1.6.1.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * Rewriting build file and including META-INF, hopefully fixing issue
    with Gmail play-by-email emailer on linux machines. (rain)
    * Changing trigger property changes to use "-reset-" instead of clear.
    Can now be used with any attachment option. (veqryn)
    * Creating a reset method for every single attachment property. These can
    now be used to return a property to its default value. (veqryn)
    * Fixing some bugs introduced into AI with the factory switch. (veqryn)
    * Fixing null pointer error in Easy AI purchasing algorithm for getting
    costs of units. (veqryn)
    * Changing maxDamage to default to 2 instead of -1. This is for bombing
    type damage, and it acts as either a multiplier of territory value or as
    a hard set number depending on canProduceXUnits. (veqryn)
    * Fixing AIs to no longer use isFactory, and instead use things like
    canProduceUnits, etc. (veqryn)
    * Abstracting isFactory setting and matches to use the component parts.
    (veqryn)
    * Deleting unit attachment, "isFactory", but keeping the setter so that
    old xml's will not break. 
        setting isFactory now just sets: canBeDamaged, isInfrastructure,
        canProduceUnits, isConstruction, constructionType = "factory",
        maxConstructionsPerTypePerTerr = 1,
        constructionsPerTerrPerTypePerTurn = 1. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Submarines Prevent Unescorted Amphibious
    Assaults", that prevent unescorted transports from conducting amphibious
    assaults. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Kamikaze Suicide Attacks Only Where Battles
    Are", and implemented it. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug where land units would disappear when conquering a sea zone.
    (veqryn)
    * Making kamikaze and interceptor dialogs non-modal so user can move
    around map while choosing. Again, saving during the dialog then reloading
    might have odd effects. (veqryn)
    * Making scramble dialog non-modal so that the user can move the map
    around before choosing what to scramble. Note that saving the game while
    in the middle of scrambling can result in weird effects, so it is not
    recommended. (veqryn)
    * Undoing update to java Substance 7.1, in order to maintain
    compatibility with Java 5. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to change the amount of unit bombing damage on any
    and all units which can be damaged by bombing. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to change the amount of unit hitpoint damage on any
    and all units which can take more than 1 point of hit damage. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to remove technology from a player, except that
    shipyards and industrial technology can never be removed, and any
    technology that uses triggers is pointless to remove and removing will
    not undo their effect. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to add technology to a player. (veqryn)
    * Adding methods to ensure that any power sharing technology (like
    British to UK Pacific) will still roll for war bonds even if its capital
    is taken, so long as the shared power is not able to have the warbonds
    technologies. (veqryn)
    * Allowing additional nations to share the cost of technology, and
    creating a good user interface that dynamically adjusts to show how much
    is being paid by each nation. (veqryn)
    * Created an option in Play-By-Forum and Play-By-Email to send the move
    summary after the combat move phase, in addition to the summary at the
    end of the turn. This is to help with OOL and scrambling orders. (veqryn)
    * Abstracted EndTurnPanel into AbstractForumPosterPanel, then created
    MoveForumPosterPanel. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Remove All Tech Tokens At End Of Turn", which
    will remove tech tokens after each tech roll. (veqryn)
    * Make savegames for long games, games with many players, and games with
    many battles, much smaller. (veqryn)
    * Changing how Battle Records get added and removed from game data
    through the Change Factory to be more memory efficient. (veqryn)
    * Adding an option for "None" to the list of territory effects. (veqryn)
    * Added List to Battle Calc so that you can manually select one or more
    territory effects, hold down shift to select more than one. List will
    automatically fill with starting territory's effects. (veqryn)
    * Fixed battle calc to make it try to use the territory that we select.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixing bug in Battle Calculator where damaged units got turned into
    healthy units before each battle was calculated. (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer error in triggerSupportChange caused by having a
    hashmap of an attachment class, inside of another attachment class, then
    deserializing this (loading a savegame), resulting in the hashmap being
    resolved before all its keys are, giving the wrong hashcodes to those
    keys. (veqryn)
    * Updating java Substance to 7.1, and adding 14 more skins. (veqryn)
    * Updated embedded Java JRE for windows executable version to Java 6
    update 33. (veqryn)
    * Added a drawing method and menu option to have territory borders drawn
    a second time on top of the map. (veqryn)
    * Changing IDrawable calls to use highest level of graphics rendering
    available. (veqryn)
    * Fixing game selector model to no longer return to default game if we
    have trouble loading the uri of previous xml, and will instead try to
    pick by name first. (veqryn)
    * Added new sounds for air, sea, and land battles, rockets, politics, and
    tech. (veqryn)
    * Fixed issue where fighters moving alone were not asked if they want to
    escort. (veqryn)
    * Made DefaultAttachment extend GameDataComponent. (veqryn)

    movementLimit, attackingLimit. (veqryn)

    * Fixed fatal error in HistoryLog, caused by clearing an array that
    potentially gets accessed later at a specific index number, from doing an
    edit during a movement phase then doing an undo later. (veqryn)

    * Created new game option, "Subs Can End NonCombat Move With Enemies",
    which allows submarines to end their noncombat movement in a sea zone
    containing any enemy units. (veqryn)

    * Added information on which units are doing the bomber to the question
    about what should each bomber bomb. (veqryn)

    * Fixed error from trying to undo a battle move created using another

    * Created new techAbilityAttachment option, "bombingBonus", which will
    add additional damage after all dice are rolled, per unit. (veqryn)

    * Created new techAbilityAttachment option, "defenseRollsBonus", which
    adds additional defense rolls. (veqryn)

    * Created new techAbilityAttachment option, "attackRollsBonus", which
    adds additional attack rolls. (veqryn)

triplea (1.3.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enabled "Set look and feel" option from menu. Thanks to Jerome Robert
    (Closes: #648716)
    - Recommends: substance, liblaf-plugin-java, liblaf-widget-java and
      removed substance from B-D. triplea will run without recommended
      packages, but will throw an error if you try to "Set look and feel".
      Play resumes normally after error.
