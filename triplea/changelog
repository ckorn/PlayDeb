    territory in order to keep that territory in the Territory Panel, no
    matter where they move their mouse afterwards. (frigoref)

    causing the second half of all rolls to not be rolled, thereby defaulting
    to one each. (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer for undoing a placement made by UK in global 1940
    maps, caused by the new no-air-checking delegate [players will need to
    update their 1940 maps though]. (veqryn)
    * Creating framework for TripleA to use proxies to connect to the
    internet. Allowing map downloading, PBEM/PBF, and dice servers to use a
    proxy. (veqryn)

triplea (1.6.1.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * Rewriting build file and including META-INF, hopefully fixing issue
    with Gmail play-by-email emailer on linux machines. (rain)
    * Changing trigger property changes to use "-reset-" instead of clear.
    Can now be used with any attachment option. (veqryn)
    * Creating a reset method for every single attachment property. These can
    now be used to return a property to its default value. (veqryn)
    * Fixing some bugs introduced into AI with the factory switch. (veqryn)
    * Fixing null pointer error in Easy AI purchasing algorithm for getting
    costs of units. (veqryn)
    * Changing maxDamage to default to 2 instead of -1. This is for bombing
    type damage, and it acts as either a multiplier of territory value or as
    a hard set number depending on canProduceXUnits. (veqryn)
    * Fixing AIs to no longer use isFactory, and instead use things like
    canProduceUnits, etc. (veqryn)
    * Abstracting isFactory setting and matches to use the component parts.
    (veqryn)
    * Deleting unit attachment, "isFactory", but keeping the setter so that
    old xml's will not break. 
        setting isFactory now just sets: canBeDamaged, isInfrastructure,
        canProduceUnits, isConstruction, constructionType = "factory",
        maxConstructionsPerTypePerTerr = 1,
        constructionsPerTerrPerTypePerTurn = 1. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Submarines Prevent Unescorted Amphibious
    Assaults", that prevent unescorted transports from conducting amphibious
    assaults. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Kamikaze Suicide Attacks Only Where Battles
    Are", and implemented it. (veqryn)
    * Fixed bug where land units would disappear when conquering a sea zone.
    (veqryn)
    * Making kamikaze and interceptor dialogs non-modal so user can move
    around map while choosing. Again, saving during the dialog then reloading
    might have odd effects. (veqryn)
    * Making scramble dialog non-modal so that the user can move the map
    around before choosing what to scramble. Note that saving the game while
    in the middle of scrambling can result in weird effects, so it is not
    recommended. (veqryn)
    * Undoing update to java Substance 7.1, in order to maintain
    compatibility with Java 5. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to change the amount of unit bombing damage on any
    and all units which can be damaged by bombing. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to change the amount of unit hitpoint damage on any
    and all units which can take more than 1 point of hit damage. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to remove technology from a player, except that
    shipyards and industrial technology can never be removed, and any
    technology that uses triggers is pointless to remove and removing will
    not undo their effect. (veqryn)
    * Created edit option to add technology to a player. (veqryn)
    * Adding methods to ensure that any power sharing technology (like
    British to UK Pacific) will still roll for war bonds even if its capital
    is taken, so long as the shared power is not able to have the warbonds
    technologies. (veqryn)
    * Allowing additional nations to share the cost of technology, and
    creating a good user interface that dynamically adjusts to show how much
    is being paid by each nation. (veqryn)
    * Created an option in Play-By-Forum and Play-By-Email to send the move
    summary after the combat move phase, in addition to the summary at the
    end of the turn. This is to help with OOL and scrambling orders. (veqryn)
    * Abstracted EndTurnPanel into AbstractForumPosterPanel, then created
    MoveForumPosterPanel. (veqryn)
    * Created new game option, "Remove All Tech Tokens At End Of Turn", which
    will remove tech tokens after each tech roll. (veqryn)
    * Make savegames for long games, games with many players, and games with
    many battles, much smaller. (veqryn)
    * Changing how Battle Records get added and removed from game data
    through the Change Factory to be more memory efficient. (veqryn)
    * Adding an option for "None" to the list of territory effects. (veqryn)
    * Added List to Battle Calc so that you can manually select one or more
    territory effects, hold down shift to select more than one. List will
    automatically fill with starting territory's effects. (veqryn)
    * Fixed battle calc to make it try to use the territory that we select.
    (veqryn)
    * Fixing bug in Battle Calculator where damaged units got turned into
    healthy units before each battle was calculated. (veqryn)
    * Fixed null pointer error in triggerSupportChange caused by having a
    hashmap of an attachment class, inside of another attachment class, then
    deserializing this (loading a savegame), resulting in the hashmap being
    resolved before all its keys are, giving the wrong hashcodes to those
    keys. (veqryn)
    * Updating java Substance to 7.1, and adding 14 more skins. (veqryn)
    * Updated embedded Java JRE for windows executable version to Java 6
    update 33. (veqryn)
    * Added a drawing method and menu option to have territory borders drawn
    a second time on top of the map. (veqryn)
    * Changing IDrawable calls to use highest level of graphics rendering
    available. (veqryn)
    * Fixing game selector model to no longer return to default game if we
    have trouble loading the uri of previous xml, and will instead try to
    pick by name first. (veqryn)
    * Added new sounds for air, sea, and land battles, rockets, politics, and
    tech. (veqryn)
    * Fixed issue where fighters moving alone were not asked if they want to
    escort. (veqryn)
    * Made DefaultAttachment extend GameDataComponent. (veqryn)

  * New upstream version
    * Updated 1940 test xml to allow Axis powers to declare war on Americans
    separately, and for Americans to declare war on each Axis power

    game, or join the lobby. (veqryn & frigoref)

    * Removed restriction of not being able to land in land territories with

    territory, and whether it was conquered this turn or not). (veqryn) 

    * Fixing possible error with using overridden placement delegates that
    were not triplea placement delegates, like using twoIfBySea place
    delegates. (frigoref)

    the battle, instead of also allowing infrastructure too. (veqryn)

triplea (1.3.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enabled "Set look and feel" option from menu. Thanks to Jerome Robert
    (Closes: #648716)
    - Recommends: substance, liblaf-plugin-java, liblaf-widget-java and
      removed substance from B-D. triplea will run without recommended
      packages, but will throw an error if you try to "Set look and feel".
      Play resumes normally after error.
