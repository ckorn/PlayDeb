* ICC colour profiles of jpegs/pngs
  - Is it ok to strip these?
    + jhead -purejpg
    + mogrify -strip

* sampling+

* Enet has a lot of GPL2+/FSF-free, Would it be possible to redistribute these
  items under Expat instead, as per the libtool/autoconf license exception, it
  would make things much neater.

* Font (currently breaking it's stated license)
  - Generated font png:s (unclear what can be done with them: "used in project
    for free", what does that mean?)
    + Would the author be willing to relicense/clarify this?
  - Are the other fonts CC-BY-SA RE-Team? (As would be implied by current
    license setup.)
    + Would it be possible to use these instead of the akashi font to get rid of
      that licensing issue?
  - Alternatively using a completely different, free font

* src/include/wincompat.h is ARR, do you have permission to distribute this
  file? And what the heck is it for anyways?

* Is it ok to strip these from the tarballs we distribute (don't need to bother
  about all the embedded licenses)?:
  src/include
  src/lib
  src/install/win	(only in svn)
  src/excode		(only in svn)
  bin/[selection]
  few more bits...
  - It would be even better if they were stripped from the Linux/BSD tarball
    completely, since it makes little sense to keep it there ;)

Wishlist:

* Relicense under something like this:
