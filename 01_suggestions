Feature Requests:
* Neither ~ nor / seems to work properly on a non US keyboard, t does though,
  or rebinding...
* Using K before you have reached the first checkpoint doesn't reset timer
  - Use home instead

Features Requsted:
* Ability to permanently disable keybindings via ingame editing
  (basically by writing a bind << "KEY" [""] >> line in the config.cfg)
  - The restoring of default values is a feature for click-happy noobs
* Bug Mike about why the prebuild linux client doesn't work on OpenSUSE
  - Bugged, no idea why, can't really do much apart from ask all users to
    recompile
  - Is it the links to /lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 that aint working here?

* Don't use the sword in time trial
  - Empty hands looked gayer
* Don't allow melee-whenever-touching by continuously holding down the [q] key,
  make it only activate melee a certain period [~< 1s?] after key is pressed,
  then turn inactive.
