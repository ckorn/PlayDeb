        Available under the GNU GPLv2 with the font exception:
        As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font,
        and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
        document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to
        be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
        however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
        by the GNU General Public License.  If you modify this font, you may
        extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not
        obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
        statement from your version.
