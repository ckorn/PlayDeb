freeciv (2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Make the SDL client depend on ttf-dejavu-core, ttf-sazanami-gothic,
    ttf-unfonts and ttf-arphic-uming, and remove the font files from the
    -data package, which had grown in size way too much in 2.1.x. For now,
    Recommends or Suggests can't be used as the client won't start at all
    if the fonts listed in the themespec are missing.
  * New patch patches/themes_sdl_use_system_fonts.diff, to make the themespec
    reference the system-wide Debian fonts for the SDL client.
  * Delete patch data_Makefile_use_sysconfdir.diff, as it has been fixed
    differently in ggz.m4.

  [ Clint Adams ]
  * Bump to Standards-Version 3.7.3.
  * Pass --with-ggzd-confdir=/etc/ggzd to configure.
  * New patch to not require ggzd at build-time.

 -- Clint Adams <schizo@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Dec 2007 13:35:59 -0500

freeciv (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove all common ggz configure flags now that ggz.m4 appears to
    be fixed upstream, and the correct path should be autodetected.
  * Pass --without-ggz-client to the sdl and xaw3d targets, as advised
    by upstream, as GGZ support in these clients is untested or incomplete.
    This removes unnecessary dependencies and leaves GTK+ as the only
    GGZ-capable client.
    Also, pass --without-ggz-server to the clients, and --without-ggz-client
    to the server.
  * Pass --enable-noregistry to avoid GGZ module registration on install.
  * Remove links file for -sound-standard, as it doesn't depend on -data
    and therefore docs can't be shared.
  * Build-Depend on x11proto-core-dev, not x-dev.
  * Require libggz* (>= 0.0.14) as per configure.in (closes: #450761).
  * Wrap build-depends.
  * Remove XS- prefixes to Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Svn control fields.
  * Install civclient.dsc in /usr/share/ggz/modules/freeciv, not /etc/ggz;
    modify postinst/preinst accordingly.
  * Update data_Makefile_use_sysconfdir.diff and data_dsc_use_bindir.diff.
  * Remove debian/patches/gtk_cma_gcc42.diff, not really needed according to
    Jason.
  * Remove a note about the old package reorganisation from README.Debian,
    as the information isn't useful or accurate anymore (closes: 403858).
  * Don't install our own .desktop file for -client-gtk, as Freeciv now
    ships one based on ours. Purposely don't ship freeciv-server.desktop,
    I don't think it should exist at all.
  * Move icons dir to the correct directory, and install it in -data.
  * Don't ship our own .png icons, so the freedesktop icons can be used
    instead. Hence, drop Build-Dep on sharutils. It'd be great if someone
    would provide xpm icons based on the official ones. :)

  [ Jordi Mallach ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Bump dependencies to the 2.1 series.
  * Add a new binary package for the new SDL client.
  * Add a new binary package for stdsounds (freeciv-sound-standard).
    Packaging bits taken from the never-released freeciv-sound-standard
    package (closes: #191796).
  * Add Homepage, XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Add GGZ support on all builds. For now, this requires specifying where
    GGZ is installed in Debian probably due to GGZ bugs.
  * Add Build-Depends on libsdl-image1.2-dev, libggzmod-dev, libggzdmod-dev
    and libggz-gtk-dev.
  * Make freeciv-client-gtk depend on ggzcore-bin, needed to register
    GGZ modules.
  * Install GGZ module files and register/unregister them at postinst/prerm
    for freeciv-client-gtk.
  * Add patch data_dsc_use_bindir.diff to fix path to Freeciv executables in
    GGZ module files. Paths are hardcoded for now, as it doesn't like
    @bindir@ as it is.
  * Move icons to freeciv-data. Add the necessary Replaces.
  * Install a png version of the server icon as well.
  * Set $sysconfdir to /etc.
  * Add the Debian menu xpm icons for all client flavours.
  * Add copyright info for some LGPL'd bits and sound origins.
  * Add a freeciv-data.NEWS file with pointers to a still unresolved issue
    with civclient crashing when trying to start a network game, if
    ~/.civclientrc was created by Freeciv 1.14.
  * Remove bootstrap/config.{guess,sub} at clean (closes: #424278).
  * Add patch gtk_cma_gcc42.diff to fix CMA getting reset in city management
    when civclient-gtk is compiled with GCC 4.2.

  [ Clint Adams ]
  * Add patch data_Makefile_use_sysconfdir.diff to use @sysconfdir@ instead
    of @prefix@/etc.

      applied upstream.
    + client doesn't crash when spying a city and pressing "Next/Prev city"
      buttons (closes: #219068).

freeciv (1.14.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major package reorganization:
    - adopt a naming scheme for freeciv packages: freeciv-mod-* for mod
      packages, freeciv-sound-* for sound packs, freeciv-tile-* for tile
      packages, freeciv-client-* for client packages.
    - move arch-independent data to freeciv-data, freeciv to freeciv-server
      and make freeciv a dummy package, which depends on freeciv-client and
      freeciv-server to ensure smooth upgrades. In Sarge+1, this package will
      be removed and made a virtual package, provided by freeciv-clients.
    - NOTE: if you just want a freeciv client and not the server, you'll
      have to manually remove the freeciv-server and freeciv packages.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    + add a note about customizing the look of GTK2 clients (closes: #187912).
    + add some explanations on the package reorganization.
  * debian/control:
    + freeciv: made a dummy package which depends on freeciv-server and
      freeciv-client.
    + freeciv-server:
      - new package, including just the server binary.
      - Depends: freeciv-data, Suggests: freeciv-client, Conflicts: old
        freeciv packages.
    + freeciv-xaw3d:
      - renamed to freeciv-client-xaw3d.
      - make freeciv-xaw3d a dummy package which just depends on
        freeciv-client-xaw3d.
      - Depends: freeciv-data, Suggests: freeciv-server, freeciv-sound,
        Provides: freeciv-client, freeciv-xaw3d, Replaces: freeciv-xaw3d.
    + freeciv-gtk: same as freeciv-xaw3d.
    + freeciv-data: new package, including arch-independent data files.
    + add Filip Van Raemdonck <mechanix@debian.org> to Uploaders:.
  * debian/freeciv.desktop: add StartupNotify support.
  * debian/rules:
    + add binary-indep rules.
    + install everything in debian/tmp and then use dh_install.
    + use $localedir on install rules instead of moving mo files later.
    + install freeciv.desktop in the GNOME2/KDE3-compatible location.
    + lots of other cruft cleaning.
  * debian/freeciv-{client-gtk,client-xaw3d,server}.links:
    + link /usr/share/doc dirs to freeciv-data's.
    + manage manpage symlinks here.
  * debian/watch: rewrite using v2 format, correct path to tarballs.
  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/graphics.c: backport a working fix for the
    Gdk-CRITICAL warnings on resizing the Freeciv logo (closes: #180138).
  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/cityrep.c: backport fix from CVS to fix a city report
    update segfault (closes: #190140).
  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/Freeciv.h: change chatline default colours to black
    on white, to make it more readable (1.14.1 will behave like this too).

freeciv (1.14.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/graphics.c: apply patch from CVS to fix Gdk-CRITICAL

    + don't lie, and really add autotools-dev to Build-Depends.
    + apply Filip Van Raemdonck's suggestions to enhance the descriptions
      (closes: #177859).
  * debian/rules: define HAVE_LIBXAW3D by hand on build-xaw, to work around a
    bug where Xaw3D wouldn't be included at compile time, making civclient-xaw
    segfault immediatelly on startup.
  * The "Learned New Tech" message has been configurable for a few versions
    (closes: #48023).
  * The "Turn done" button obeys the GTK theme with GTK2 (closes: #127048).
  * The package correctly removes alternatives (closes: #176113).

    + Standards-Version: 3.5.8.0.
  * debian/compat: use DH_COMPAT=4.
  * debian/docs: add a list of individual docs, don't just glob, as there's
    stuff we don't want at all.
  * debian/rules:
    + pass DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE to the configure call.
    + symlink config.sub and config.guess to those provided by autotools-dev
      on configure, rm them on clean.
    + add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    + remove DH_COMPAT definition.
    + add --enable-client arguments to build-gtk and build-xaw3d.
    + other build fixes.

    non-patched clients/servers would react to this (closes: #153018).
  * Maintainer release, closing NMU fixed bugs (closes: #170901, #47352,
    #88539, #92096, #94485, #94486, #94487, #94488, #95203, #100768, #140618,

freeciv (1.13.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload, after trying to contact Jules with no luck.
  * This release was cooked up by Filip Van Raemdonck and Jordi Mallach,
    in an amazing lesson of cooperation.
  * New upstream version, which works with online servers (closes: #154329).
  * Correct the description (closes: #124640).
  * Install the upstream changelog only once (closes: #140618).
  * Remove the emacs variables from this changelog.
  * Remove the debian/obsolete/ directory.
  * Build with GTK+ 2.0. This means gdk-imlib-dev is no longer needed. Update
    Build-Depends:.
    Remove unneeded include of gdk_imlib.h.
  * Update Standards-Version:.
  * Update the client packages to depend on freeciv >= 1.13.
  * Set DH_COMPAT=3 to allow globbing for doc/*.
    Install the server and data files into debian/freeciv/ since compatibility
    level 3 expects them there.
    Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages.
  * Don't install HOWTOPLAY into the freeciv package twice.
  * The repeated sentence has been fixed in this version (closes: #108385).
  * Fixes and additions for the .desktop file (closes: #153413).
  * Compress game scenarios (closes: #113499).
  * Not applying patch in #153018, letting Jules decide. I (Jordi) think it's
    a bad idea, not knowing how it'll look when playing in a non-Debian
    server.
  * Remove po/nl.gmo in clean so it builds ok the second time.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Aug 2002 21:18:06 +0200

freeciv (1.12.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload with Jules' permission.
  * New upstream version. Fixes a memory leak in the xaw3d
    client, and an issue with the Colosseum help. As far as I can tell the goto
    bug report is also fixed.
    (Closes: #24037, #88539, #100768, #106283, #108038)
  * Increase Standards-Version.
  * Add Build-Depends. (Closes: #68964, #92096)
  * Add alternatives for civclient, not only civ. (Closes: #47352, #71276)
  * Add readline support. (Closes: #94492)
  * Remove kludge for pot files not getting installed; add another one for pot
    files getting installed in the wrong location.
  * Move freeciv-{gtk,xaw3d}.postrm to .prerm for update-alternatives.
  * Bump server package version in clients dependencies.
    (Closes: #94486, #95203)
  * Remove xaw3dg from Depends: in control for freeciv-xaw3d; dh_shlibdeps
    takes care of this. (Closes: #94485)
  * Add --without-zlib to the clients configure calls so it doesn't get linked
    in (clients don't need it). (Closes: #94487, #94488)
  * Fix typo in nl translation.
  * Go through bugs and weed out the already fixed ones. (Closes: #47352)
  * Yay! I got more bugs fixed as Thorsten did (15 vs. 16).

    - initial version of proper diplomacy (at war, pacts, etc.)
    - many other changes, check the NEWS file!

    - dazzling number of nations to choose from
    - worklist (select the next N things to build in a city)
  * Merging back Torsten's changes - thank you Torsten

 -- Lalo Martins <lalo@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Feb 2000 14:06:55 -0200

freeciv (1.9.0-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload.
  * Make the client packages depend on freeciv >= 1.9 (closes: #49667).
  * Disabled building of the empty freeciv-xaw package which made no sense.
  * Added --cache-file option to configure invocations to speed up the
    build process.
  * Installed HOWTOPLAY into each package since it is quite small compared
    to the overall size of the software (closes: #36091).
  * Made the whole beast FHS compliant (closes: #49506).
  * Installed changelog into each package (lintian).
  * Made a doc directory for each package.
  * Removed icon="none" from menu files (lintian).
  * Added #DEBHELPER# to install/remove scripts.
  * Removed calls to update-menus from scripts because debhelper already
    takes care of this and there is a small time penalty on (de)installation.
  * Updated location of GPL license in copyright file.
  * Made civ.1.gz a slave of civ so that man civ will work (closes: 47352)
  * Checked old bug reports:
    - Help window stays after reconnecting (closes: #48016)
    - /usr/games/civ is not any longer a script but maintained by the
      alternatives system (closes: #25589)
    - civclient-gtk is dynamically linked (closes: #48017). Probably the
      problem was the result of a defect GTK installation during the
      build.
    - according to the logs, bug 26795 was fixed upstream (closes: #26795)
    - resizing does not produce any gaps with the current version
      (closes: #26797)
    - dh_clean takes care of removing debian/files (closes: #32780)
    - Debian unstable version is current (closes: #38980, #48221)
  * As the freeciv-xaw package is no longer build it can't have a bug *eg*
    - the bad link is not anymore (closes: #48214)
    - update-xaw-wrappers is not needed/called anymore (closes: #24108)
    - another problem with xaw is a non-issue (closes: #26396)
    - We do not care for alternatives vs. xaw-wrappers anymore (closes: #31907)
    - The new xaw-wrappers config format does not tangle us (closes: #37111)
    - Non-existent civclient-xaw will not segfault ;) (closes: #38368)

freeciv (1.9.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabled the building of the freeciv-xaw package because if nobody uses
    it, it's not worth the xaw-wrappers headaches

    a virtual package Provided by the 2 client packages (3 for the CVS
    snapshots). The xaw client is moved to the freeciv-xaw package.

    incompatible)

freeciv (1.7.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed lots of glitches in debianization of the new status quo:
    + We no longer need the "civ" script because we now set datadir in
      configure
    + Made "civ" into an alternative, to cope with future binary packages
      freeciv-xaw3d and freeciv-gtk
    + The menu entry for the client does not point to "civ" anymore but to
      "civclient"; changed the label to state that it's the "(traditional
      Athena version)"
    + Manually stripping binaries till I get around to rewrite debian/rules
      for debhelper
  * Notice: 1.7.2-1 wouldn't work at all, if you have it you need to upgrade

freeciv (1.0k-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Installed config entry for xaw-wrappers, because freeciv requires
    the original Xaw library.
  * Recommend xaw-wrappers for that reason.
  * Previous changelog was incorrect: I decided not to install menu
    entries after all, because the programs are not very useful when
    run without flags.
