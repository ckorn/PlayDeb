freeciv (2.4.1-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
       2.4.1 is mostly a bug-fix release; it includes fixes for server and
       client crashes, and some AI improvements.

    Server / general

    Changes affecting players (supplied rulesets)

         * If the 'revealmap' server setting was set to show the initial
         state
           of the map to players on game start, loading a savegame of that
           game would freshly reveal the current state of the map to all
           players. GNA#21172
         * Fix some bugs in Freeciv's inferences about ruleset effects in the
           absence of complete information. These are low-level changes whose
           effects are hard to quantify, but should be more correct; they are
           most likely to affect client behavior and the AI. The bugs
           affected:
              + A particular ruleset definition ('negated' requirements)
              which
                is not used in any of the supplied rulesets. GNA#21144
              + Requirements for the presence of a certain building.
              GNA#21147
         * Autosettlers could erroneously believe that by building irrigation
           or a mine, specials of the other kind would be removed. This is
           true of the supplied rulesets, but may not be true of other
           rulesets. GNA#21192
         * In rulesets such as civ1 where chains of adjacent cities can
         create
           'channels' allowing sea units inland, if a city is lost (cutting
           off the channel), any units now landlocked are correctly
           destroyed.
           GNA#21219
         * Quell some warnings when loading the civ1 ruleset. GNA#20770
         * Bug fix: random connection loss could occur due to disagreement
           between client and server about the interpretation of certain
           compressed network packets. This only affects a very few exact
           packet sizes, so you'd have to be quite unlucky to run into it; it
           is most likely to manifest when the client first connects to the
           server, in which case only the server needs upgrading to avoid the
           issue. GNA#21300
         * The server sent incorrect information to the client about wonders
           which have been built by players and then lost. This is not known
           to have any adverse effects. GNA#21096

    Changes affecting other rulesets / modders

         * Consider bases when automatically determining a unit's Move_Type
           when not explicitly specified by the ruleset author. GNA#21022
         * Do not emit errors for rulesets with no nation groups defined.
           GNAPATCH#4300
         * If a ruleset defined too many nation groups/sets, this error was
           not reported clearly. GNAPATCH#4299

    Changes affecting server operators

         * The server could crash if '/remove' was used in the pre-game.
           GNA#21202
         * Fail more gracefully if a map is generated with no land for
         players
           to start on. GNA#21068
         * In the case where the game cannot start due to there being
           insufficient nations for all players, ensure everyone is notified.
           GNA#21207
         * '/mapimg colortest' caused assertion failures and a possible
         server
           crash. GNA#21159
         * Fix a harmless warning in the verbose log 'unused entry:
           savefile.specials_size' when loading a savefile. GNA#19836
         * Fix some recent regressions in the 'freeciv-manual' utility.
         (Note,
           however, that it still has large gaps and is of limited use
           outside
           the development team.)
              + Broken server settings documentation. GNA#21063 GNA#21099
              + Potential trouble finding the default ruleset definitions.
                GNA#21086
         * Bring the included Lua 5.1 up to date with the latest patch (patch
           2). GNAPATCH#4068
         * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
           GNA#21015 GNA#21206 GNA#21232 GNA#21238

    AI

         * Fix bugs in the AI's 'ferry' system (for handling boats and
         similar
           transports):
              + A bug which could possibly lead to AI boats left in an
                unusable state, and overproduction of boats. GNA#20978
              + General contradiction within the code about which units use
                the ferry system, which could cause trouble with unusual
                transports, such as non-seagoing ones (Triremes in the
                experimental ruleset, which can navigate rivers) and
                transports which cannot carry non-land units (such as
                Carriers). GNA#21154
         * Fix bugs in AI's evaluation of which attacker units to build:
              + The logic for determining whether they would be built as
                veteran was wrong in many ways, including treating
                veterancy-granting buildings in a city as a downside rather
                than upside, and not handling veterancy-granting wonders.
                GNAPATCH#4014
              + When planning to attack a city, units which could occupy
                cities only had that ability taken into account, not any
                ability to destroy enemy units; now both are taken into
                account. As a result, the AI may now prefer building land
                units rather than ships. GNAPATCH#4015
         * The AI's logic for deciding when to try bribing units was flawed.
           It would give up if the enemy's cities were unbribable, and would
           not take into account whether the unit (or all the enemy's units)
           were unbribable. GNA#21064 GNA#21136
         * Ensure that AI never considers a ruleset effect with zero value as
           a reason to build an improvement. (Should not affect most
           rulesets,
           but may sometimes occur when testing a new ruleset.) GNAPATCH#4289
         * Fix AI behavior in the presence of negative Size_Unlimit effects
         in
           the ruleset. It could consider buildings with such effects a bonus
           rather than a liability, and if a city ended up with a net
           negative
           value for this effect, the AI would never go for buildings which
           could increase the city size limit. GNA#21240
         * For AI developers: the 'unit_got' callback could be called with
         the
           wrong owner when a unit's home city changed. (This does not affect
           the default AI, as it does not use this callback.) GNA#21200

    Clients

         * National borders would disappear from the map when the local
           settings dialog was opened for the first time. (Unit background
           colors would also be wrongly displayed, if enabled.) GNA#21116
           GNA#21151
         * The client could crash if the user accepted a tileset suggestion
           made by the ruleset. GNA#21231
         * In the Nations report, show a status even for disconnected players
           (including whether they are blocking turn change). GNA#21023
         * Fix minor bugs in the handling of CMA settings. Unlikely to have a
           functional effect on most platforms (beyond slightly smaller
           savefiles). GNA#21295
         * (Gtk) Fix a possible crash when pressing the Tab key in the
           chatline, and some other issues with non-ASCII characters and tab
           completion. GNA#21293
         * (Gtk) Stop the 'Number of Players (including AI)' control's state
           for single-player games from getting out of sync with the spawned
           server. GNA#21179
         * (Gtk2, Windows) If additional Gtk themes are installed, the
         Freeciv
           theme no longer leaks through in places. As a side effect, the
           modpack installer is no longer themed. GNA#21163
         * (Gtk3) Activating (double-clicking) a row in the city report would
           sometimes randomly fail to pop up the city dialog. GNAPATCH#4294
         * (Gtk3) Fix selling buildings from the city dialog. GNA#20984
         * (Gtk3) The end-game score list and the citizen nationality list
           were both drawn too small. GNA#21108
         * (Xaw) Client now identifies itself as 'gui-xaw' on its startup
           screen. GNAPATCH#4064

    Tilesets / Art

         * New nuclear explosion graphics for the Amplio2 and Trident
           rulesets. GNAPATCH#4003

    Help / Documentation

         * Minor improvements to user documentation and in-game text.
           GNAPATCH#4092 GNAPATCH#19452
         * Miscellaneous improvements to developer/ruleset docs.
         GNAPATCH#4187
           GNAPATCH#4267 GNAPATCH#4275 GNA#20872
         * Invisible changes to assist translation. GNAPATCH#4290

    Translations

         * The language code 'no' is no longer listed in the Windows
           installer, since it was just a copy of the language 'nb'
           (Norwegian
           Bokmål). GNAPATCH#4134
         * The Windows installer now lists languages by name rather than
           obscure language code. GNA#21060
         * Updated translations:
              + Complete translations: Catalan, Polish, British English.
              + Incomplete translations: French (>99.9%).

    Build/portability

         * Fix a build failure when building from scratch in the presence of
           automake 1.8, and document the minimum requirement of automake
           1.9.
           (This did not affect normal building from the distributed
           tarballs.) GNA#21216
         * Install documentation as part of 'make install'. GNAPATCH#4072
         * A Windows installer can now be built for the Gtk3 client as well
         as
           the Gtk2 client. GNATASK#7681
         * If just the Gtk3 client was installed, it was accompanied by a
           non-working .desktop file. Fix this, and add a .desktop file for
           the SDL client too. GNA#21243
         * Fix potential trouble when building for BeOS. GNA#21153
         * Fix trouble building a distribution without localization.
         GNA#21139
         * Fix a compiler warning on builds without --enable-debug. GNA#21237
         * Build is now warning-clean on GCC 4.8 -O3. GNAPATCH#4255

freeciv (2.4.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version

 -- Christoph Korn <christoph.korn@getdeb.net>  Sat, 14 Sep 2013 22:58:12 +0200

freeciv (2.3.4-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
       The main reason for this release is to fix a client crash triggered by
       chat messages; see below. Other than that, there is the usual set of
       bugfixes.

    Server / General

    Gameplay

    * Bug fix: when a unit was automatically moved to a transporter to
      save it from drowning or running out of fuel, the transporter could
      continue to appear empty. GNA#20454
    * Bug fixes in unit conversion and upgrade GNA#20452:
    + Prevent cases where units could be converted or upgraded to a
      type only capable of carrying different cargo to the current
      cargo.
    + Prevent conversion of a unit to a type that could not exist on
      the current tile.
    * Units of types the owner cannot build are no longer prevented from
      upgrade. GNA#20460
    * Bug fix: quell spurious "No diplomat action possible" message when
      an ordinary attempt to move a diplomatic unit failed. GNA#20150
    * Following on from a fix in 2.3.3, when a border source such as a
      fortress is occupied by a unit of a nation other than the owner
      when a ceasefire runs out, ownership now transfers to that of the
      occupying unit. GNA#20348
    * When acquiring a technology such as Philosophy which gives further
      techs by an unusual route (such as through a hut), all progress
      toward the current research target was lost. Now it is preserved
      (although 'freecost' is applied). GNA#20362
    * Bug fix: when a city is traded and hence units change ownership, it
      wasn't checked whether those units provided diplomatic contact to a
      new nation. GNA#20431
    * Bug fix: assertion failure during map generation when no unit in
      the ruleset satisfied the first role in 'startunits'. GNA#19886
    * Bug fix: the tech upkeep with tech_cost_style 2 or 4 was much lower
      than intended; it only took into account a single tech rather than
      all preceding techs. As a result, tech upkeep in such rulesets will
      greatly increase. GNA#20063
    + The currently downloadable 'civ2-3' modpack (2.3-2c) thus has
      tech upkeep disabled. You may want to update your copy.
    * An unknown effect requirement type in a ruleset now causes a
      loading error rather than being silently interpreted as "None".
      GNA#20462

    Clerical

    * When a new nation is created in the editor, city style and leader
      sex are now set appropriately (previously they were always European
      and male). GNA#19313
    * A hardcoded year of -4000 is no longer sent to the metaserver in
      pregame, as it is ruleset-dependent. GNA#17862
    * One code tidy-up with no user-visible effect. GNA#20458

    Clients

    * The client could crash when your name was mentioned in chat but you
      had set the 'highlight your player/user name' setting to no color.
      This could also prevent any connection to a server with the event
      cache enabled if your player name had been mentioned in the past.
      GNA#20478
    + Older clients can work around this bug by setting a highlight
      colour in their local options (you may need to start a local
      game in order to access the configuration dialog).
    * Fix possible instability when loading some tilesets. GNA#20055

    Tilesets / Art

    * Some internal SVG format fixes in the supplied flags to allow their
      use in web browsers; this has no effect on Freeciv itself.
      GNAPATCH#3574

    AI

    * Fix some incorrect inferences about the ability of transported
      units or units in cities to defend; these are most likely to affect
      unusual rulesets (e.g., those with ocean cities). GNA#20483

    Help / Documentation

    * Minor improvements to user documentation and in-game text.
      GNAPATCH#3592 GNAPATCH#3594 GNAPATCH#3634 GNAPATCH#3662
    * Miscellaneous improvements to developer/ruleset docs. GNAPATCH#3575
      GNAPATCH#3595 GNAPATCH#3602 GNAPATCH#3603 GNAPATCH#3640
      GNAPATCH#3660

    Translations

    * The Spanish, Polish, and French translations are once more
      complete.

    Build/portability

    * Fix various compiler warnings. It's now possible to build Freeciv
      with GCC 4.7 optimisation level -O3 without any warnings. GNA#19386
      GNA#19385 GNA#20443 GNA#20413 GNA#20447 GNA#20444
    * Future-proof against automake versions which ignore
      ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS. GNAPATCH#3585
    * Suppress warnings about use of deprecated declarations in debug
      builds, allowing compilation on for instance recent OpenSUSE.
      GNA#20428

 -- Christoph Korn <christoph.korn@getdeb.net>  Sat, 16 Feb 2013 23:59:04 +0100

freeciv (2.3.3-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    Gameplay

    * Bug fix: players' endgame scores could be too high due to the
      future techs state not being initialised correctly at the start of
      the game; this could lead to incorrect ranking. The fix will only
      help with games started with a new version of the server;
      in-progress games will continue to have incorrect scores. GNA#19745
    * Bug fix: allied victory (enabled by default) never occurred.
      GNA#17986
    * Freeciv now infers that ruleset effects are possible in more cases
      where incomplete information is available. This is a low-level
      change whose effects are hard to quantify, but should be more
      correct; it is most likely to affect client behaviour and the AI.
      GNA#20304
    * More types of units are now permitted to auto-explore - only those
      with fuel or which lose hitpoints are prevented. In particular,
      Triremes in the 'experimental' ruleset can now auto-explore.
      GNA#17958
    * Bug fix: goto planning could erroneously consider it impossible for
      a unit to move to a city on non-native terrain. It was still
      possible to make such a move with the cursor keys. (Does not affect
      supplied rulesets.) GNA#19611
    * Bug fix: following on from 2.3.2, more assertion failure fixes when
      many autosettlers try to work on the same project. GNA#20240
    * Bug fixes in unit destruction:
    + Many more cases of unit loss now contribute to the final
      score, notably including units on board a transport unit when
      it was lost. GNA#20300 GNA#20301
    + The "unit_lost" scripting signal was not emitted for units on
      board a transport unit when it was lost. (This bug had no
      effect on the supplied rulesets.) GNA#20221
    * Bug fixes for border sources such as fortresses:
    + When a border source within range of a city was invaded, tile
      ownership from the first source did not change hands
      correctly. GNA#19831
    + When a border source changed hands and the new owner did not
      know all the territory in range, the old owner could
      erroneously retain some tiles. GNA#19983
    + When a border source is occupied by a unit of a nation other
      than the owner at the time a treaty between the two players
      breaks, ownership now transfers to that of the occupying unit.
      (partial fix for GNA#20348)
    * Bug fix: with foggedborders enabled, tile ownership could appear to
      change back to an old owner when it went out of sight. GNA#18588
      GNA#19627 GNA#19637
    * Fix possible trouble when upgrading a highly-veteran unit to a type
      with fewer veteran levels. GNA#19913
    * Bug fix: in tech loss situations, future tech would fail to be
      removed from a player, with an assertion failure. GNA#20220
    * Bug fix: the full range of the 'trademindist' setting (1-999) could
      not be transmitted over the network to the client. This caused a
      cosmetic problem in the help for the 'civ2-3' ruleset. GNA#19977
    * Bug fix: server-side AI assertion failure in rulesets with
      paratroopers and ocean cities. GNA#20230

    Clerical

    * Security fix: malformed network packets could cause denial of
      service (memory exhaustion or CPU-bound loop). GNA#20003
    * Bug fix: if the server was started with one ruleset and then
      another with a different number of governments was loaded (e.g.,
      'default' then 'multiplayer'), it could crash. GNA#19800
    * Bug fix: ordinary save files from a game started from a scenario
      file could themselves be saved as scenario files, and thus be
      listed as unwanted options when starting a new scenario game.
      GNA#19919
    * When a scenario is saved, scenario information is included earlier
      in the file, to speed up the 'Start Scenario Game' dialog.
      GNAPATCH#3497
    * It is now possible to save games with names containing dots -
      previously, everything after the first dot was stripped. GNA#18781
    * Bug fixes to scorelog/ranklog:
    + Player deletion was logged incorrectly in scorelog, causing
      warnings when resuming the game from a save file. GNA#20069
    + When a new user took over a player from another user, the old
      username could persist in the ranklog file. GNAPATCH#3526
    + Taking over a dead AI player no longer changes their username
      in the ranklog. GNAPATCH#3547
    * Tab-completion on the server command line has been improved;
      notably, enumerated and bitwise options are now completed.
      GNAPATCH#3436
    * Fix a possible crash when the '/cmdlevel' server command is issued.
      GNA#19878
    * More robustness against malformed network packets. GNA#20107
    * Minor performance improvements in certain specific situations.
      GNA#19823 GNAPATCH#3334
    * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
      GNA#19585 GNAPATCH#3205 GNA#15743 GNA#19564 GNAPATCH#3081

    Clients

    * Bug fix: assertion failure in get_internal_string_length() on
      client start on some platforms. GNA#17373
    * Fix a couple of issues with units with a zero move rate (no such
      units exist in the supplied rulesets):
    + The 'exhausted' icon was always shown for such units; now it
      is never shown. GNA#20270
    + Such units are now not skipped when focusing on the next unit.
      GNAPATCH#3567
    * Reduce memory usage after game start with large tilesets. GNA#16995
      GNA#19605
    * The default metaserver URL has been updated in line with future
      plans. (The old URL will continue to work for the foreseeable
      future.) GNAPATCH#3453 GNA#20014
    * Saved configurations now correctly save the default metaserver URL
      as "default", so that future changes to the default will be picked
      up. GNA#20015
    * (Gtk) Fix migration of chat/message window arrangement settings
      from 2.2.x. (This will not help you if you've ever run a previous
      2.3.x version; you'll have to restore your preference manually, if
      you haven't already.) GNA#19888
    * (Gtk) Fix possible colour inaccuracy. GNAPATCH#3344
    * Additional robustness in the face of odd server behaviour.
      GNA#13701

    Tilesets / Art

    * Bug fix: in the hex2t tileset, the fogged parts of the minimap were
      far too dark. GNA#16900
    * In the supplied Amplio2 tileset, the 'Refugee' graphic has been
      enabled, for the benefit of custom modpacks such as civ2-3.
      GNA#3455

    Gameplay / Rules Changes

    Supplied rulesets

    * The supplied earth-80x50-v3 scenario could not be loaded at all in
      a release build. GNA#20050
    * In rulesets with a 'watchtower' vision bonus for fortresses, the
      bonus now only applies to ground units in the fortress, not to air
      units flying over it. GNA#19866
    * Bug fix: in the 'multiplayer' ruleset, players could gain free
      techs multiple times by rebuilding Darwin's Voyage (fixed by
      GNA#19852).
    * Bug fix: in the 'experimental' ruleset, Triremes could not attack
      outwards from a city. GNA#19828
    * The script.lua files for the civ1/civ2 rulesets had been
      accidentally omitted from the distribution, although this had no
      functional effect. GNA#19907
    * Ruleset tidy-ups with no functional effect. GNA#20020 GNA#19991

    Other rulesets

    * A custom ruleset effect can now have both Oceanic and Land
      requirements in a single list. GNA#19916
    * The give_technology() Lua script function now returns 'nil' if the
      player already has the technology, as documented; previously it
      returned the Tech_Type 'None'. GNA#19852
    * The total Max_Rates effect value is now clipped to its legal range,
      so it's no longer necessary for custom rulesets to take care to
      keep the total value below 100% to avoid server misbehaviour.
      GNAPATCH#3343
    * The MinYear effect now allows years earlier than -4000. GNA#17862

    AI

    * Fixes for a couple of server crashes (division by zero):
    + In rulesets with tech upkeep, when evaluating the value of
      'Tech_Parasite' effects (e.g., Great Library), players who are
      losing bulbs are no longer considered. GNA#20234
    + Division by zero could occur when evaluating poor city
      locations. GNA#20239
    * AI behaviour is likely to change as a result of GNA#20304. For
      instance, it might be more likely to research a tech to allow it to
      build a kind of building without being certain that that building's
      other prerequisites will ever be fulfilled.

    Help / Documentation

    * Government-wide effects on unhappiness caused by military units
      were not mentioned in the online help. (In many of the supplied
      rulesets, the Republic government type suppresses unhappiness
      caused by one unit per city.) GNA#17905
    * The shipped FAQ has been updated from the wiki version.
      GNAPATCH#3420
    * NEWS in the distribution now contains a change list between major
      versions, rather than just being a pointer to wiki; a new file
      NEWS-2.3 lists differences between recent minor versions.
      GNAPATCH#3488
    * A manual page is now included for the 'freeciv-manual' utility.
      GNA#19227
    * Other minor improvements to user documentation and in-game text.
      GNA#19860 GNA#19908 GNAPATCH#3368 GNAPATCH#3398 GNAPATCH#3431
      GNA#20019 GNA#20021 GNAPATCH#3500
    * Miscellaneous improvements to developer/ruleset docs. GNA#18015
      GNAPATCH#3359
    * Invisible changes to assist translation. GNA#19870

    Translations

    * New translations: Serbian (33%), Bulgarian (31%).
    * Updated translations:
    + Complete translations: Spanish, Catalan, Scottish Gaelic.
    + Incomplete translations: Dutch (72%), Irish (56%).

    Build/portability

    * The configure script could fail to detect SDL_mixer, for instance
      on Fedora with hardened build options set. GNAPATCH#3519
    * The embedded Lua build now respects the --without-readline
      configure option, fixing a possible failure to build on systems
      without readline. GNA#20219
    * Autoconfiguration macros for X now avoid non-portable '=='.
      GNA#20002
    * The material used to build Windows installers is now included in
      the distribution. GNA#19088 GNAPATCH#3357 GNAPATCH#3365
    * Warning fixes on various platforms. GNAPATCH#3466 GNA#20013

  * New upstream release.
  * Make the SDL client depend on ttf-dejavu-core, ttf-sazanami-gothic,
    ttf-unfonts and ttf-arphic-uming, and remove the font files from the
    -data package, which had grown in size way too much in 2.1.x. For now,
    Recommends or Suggests can't be used as the client won't start at all

freeciv (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove all common ggz configure flags now that ggz.m4 appears to
    be fixed upstream, and the correct path should be autodetected.
  * Pass --without-ggz-client to the sdl and xaw3d targets, as advised
    by upstream, as GGZ support in these clients is untested or incomplete.
    This removes unnecessary dependencies and leaves GTK+ as the only
    GGZ-capable client.
    Also, pass --without-ggz-server to the clients, and --without-ggz-client
    to the server.
  * Pass --enable-noregistry to avoid GGZ module registration on install.
  * Remove links file for -sound-standard, as it doesn't depend on -data
    and therefore docs can't be shared.
  * Build-Depend on x11proto-core-dev, not x-dev.
  * Require libggz* (>= 0.0.14) as per configure.in (closes: #450761).
  * Wrap build-depends.
  * Remove XS- prefixes to Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Svn control fields.
  * Install civclient.dsc in /usr/share/ggz/modules/freeciv, not /etc/ggz;
    modify postinst/preinst accordingly.
  * Update data_Makefile_use_sysconfdir.diff and data_dsc_use_bindir.diff.
  * Remove debian/patches/gtk_cma_gcc42.diff, not really needed according to
    Jason.
  * Remove a note about the old package reorganisation from README.Debian,
    as the information isn't useful or accurate anymore (closes: 403858).
  * Don't install our own .desktop file for -client-gtk, as Freeciv now
    ships one based on ours. Purposely don't ship freeciv-server.desktop,
    I don't think it should exist at all.
  * Move icons dir to the correct directory, and install it in -data.
  * Don't ship our own .png icons, so the freedesktop icons can be used
    instead. Hence, drop Build-Dep on sharutils. It'd be great if someone
    would provide xpm icons based on the official ones. :)

  * Add Homepage, XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Add GGZ support on all builds. For now, this requires specifying where
    GGZ is installed in Debian probably due to GGZ bugs.
  * Add Build-Depends on libsdl-image1.2-dev, libggzmod-dev, libggzdmod-dev

freeciv (1.14.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major package reorganization:
    - adopt a naming scheme for freeciv packages: freeciv-mod-* for mod
      packages, freeciv-sound-* for sound packs, freeciv-tile-* for tile
      packages, freeciv-client-* for client packages.
    - move arch-independent data to freeciv-data, freeciv to freeciv-server
      and make freeciv a dummy package, which depends on freeciv-client and
      freeciv-server to ensure smooth upgrades. In Sarge+1, this package will
      be removed and made a virtual package, provided by freeciv-clients.
    - NOTE: if you just want a freeciv client and not the server, you'll
      have to manually remove the freeciv-server and freeciv packages.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    + add a note about customizing the look of GTK2 clients (closes: #187912).
    + add some explanations on the package reorganization.

      freeciv-client.

      - renamed to freeciv-client-xaw3d.
      - make freeciv-xaw3d a dummy package which just depends on
        freeciv-client-xaw3d.
      - Depends: freeciv-data, Suggests: freeciv-server, freeciv-sound,
        Provides: freeciv-client, freeciv-xaw3d, Replaces: freeciv-xaw3d.
    + freeciv-gtk: same as freeciv-xaw3d.
    + freeciv-data: new package, including arch-independent data files.
    + add Filip Van Raemdonck <mechanix@debian.org> to Uploaders:.
  * debian/freeciv.desktop: add StartupNotify support.
  * debian/rules:
    + add binary-indep rules.
    + install everything in debian/tmp and then use dh_install.

    update segfault (closes: #190140).
  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/Freeciv.h: change chatline default colours to black
    on white, to make it more readable (1.14.1 will behave like this too).

    + apply Filip Van Raemdonck's suggestions to enhance the descriptions
      (closes: #177859).
  * debian/rules: define HAVE_LIBXAW3D by hand on build-xaw, to work around a
    bug where Xaw3D wouldn't be included at compile time, making civclient-xaw
    segfault immediatelly on startup.
  * The "Learned New Tech" message has been configurable for a few versions
    (closes: #48023).
  * The "Turn done" button obeys the GTK theme with GTK2 (closes: #127048).
  * The package correctly removes alternatives (closes: #176113).

    stuff we don't want at all.
  * debian/rules:
    + pass DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE to the configure call.
    + symlink config.sub and config.guess to those provided by autotools-dev
      on configure, rm them on clean.
    + add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    + remove DH_COMPAT definition.
    + add --enable-client arguments to build-gtk and build-xaw3d.
    + other build fixes.

    non-patched clients/servers would react to this (closes: #153018).
  * Maintainer release, closing NMU fixed bugs (closes: #170901, #47352,
    #88539, #92096, #94485, #94486, #94487, #94488, #95203, #100768, #140618,

freeciv (1.13.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload, after trying to contact Jules with no luck.
  * This release was cooked up by Filip Van Raemdonck and Jordi Mallach,
    in an amazing lesson of cooperation.
  * New upstream version, which works with online servers (closes: #154329).
  * Correct the description (closes: #124640).
  * Install the upstream changelog only once (closes: #140618).
  * Remove the emacs variables from this changelog.
  * Remove the debian/obsolete/ directory.
  * Build with GTK+ 2.0. This means gdk-imlib-dev is no longer needed. Update
    Build-Depends:.
    Remove unneeded include of gdk_imlib.h.
  * Update Standards-Version:.
  * Update the client packages to depend on freeciv >= 1.13.
  * Set DH_COMPAT=3 to allow globbing for doc/*.
    Install the server and data files into debian/freeciv/ since compatibility
    level 3 expects them there.
    Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages.
  * Don't install HOWTOPLAY into the freeciv package twice.
  * The repeated sentence has been fixed in this version (closes: #108385).
  * Fixes and additions for the .desktop file (closes: #153413).
  * Compress game scenarios (closes: #113499).
  * Not applying patch in #153018, letting Jules decide. I (Jordi) think it's
    a bad idea, not knowing how it'll look when playing in a non-Debian
    server.
  * Remove po/nl.gmo in clean so it builds ok the second time.

freeciv (1.12.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload with Jules' permission.
  * New upstream version. Fixes a memory leak in the xaw3d
    client, and an issue with the Colosseum help. As far as I can tell the goto
    bug report is also fixed.
    (Closes: #24037, #88539, #100768, #106283, #108038)
  * Increase Standards-Version.
  * Add Build-Depends. (Closes: #68964, #92096)
  * Add alternatives for civclient, not only civ. (Closes: #47352, #71276)
  * Add readline support. (Closes: #94492)
  * Remove kludge for pot files not getting installed; add another one for pot
    files getting installed in the wrong location.
  * Move freeciv-{gtk,xaw3d}.postrm to .prerm for update-alternatives.
  * Bump server package version in clients dependencies.
    (Closes: #94486, #95203)
  * Remove xaw3dg from Depends: in control for freeciv-xaw3d; dh_shlibdeps
    takes care of this. (Closes: #94485)
  * Add --without-zlib to the clients configure calls so it doesn't get linked
    in (clients don't need it). (Closes: #94487, #94488)
  * Fix typo in nl translation.
  * Go through bugs and weed out the already fixed ones. (Closes: #47352)
  * Yay! I got more bugs fixed as Thorsten did (15 vs. 16).

freeciv (1.11.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, including:

    - initial version of proper diplomacy (at war, pacts, etc.)
    - many other changes, check the NEWS file!

    - dazzling number of nations to choose from
    - worklist (select the next N things to build in a city)
  * Merging back Torsten's changes - thank you Torsten

freeciv (1.9.0-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload.
  * Make the client packages depend on freeciv >= 1.9 (closes: #49667).
  * Disabled building of the empty freeciv-xaw package which made no sense.
  * Added --cache-file option to configure invocations to speed up the
    build process.
  * Installed HOWTOPLAY into each package since it is quite small compared
    to the overall size of the software (closes: #36091).
  * Made the whole beast FHS compliant (closes: #49506).
  * Installed changelog into each package (lintian).
  * Made a doc directory for each package.
  * Removed icon="none" from menu files (lintian).
  * Added #DEBHELPER# to install/remove scripts.
  * Removed calls to update-menus from scripts because debhelper already
    takes care of this and there is a small time penalty on (de)installation.
  * Updated location of GPL license in copyright file.
  * Made civ.1.gz a slave of civ so that man civ will work (closes: 47352)
  * Checked old bug reports:
    - Help window stays after reconnecting (closes: #48016)
    - /usr/games/civ is not any longer a script but maintained by the
      alternatives system (closes: #25589)
    - civclient-gtk is dynamically linked (closes: #48017). Probably the
      problem was the result of a defect GTK installation during the
      build.
    - according to the logs, bug 26795 was fixed upstream (closes: #26795)
    - resizing does not produce any gaps with the current version
      (closes: #26797)
    - dh_clean takes care of removing debian/files (closes: #32780)
    - Debian unstable version is current (closes: #38980, #48221)
  * As the freeciv-xaw package is no longer build it can't have a bug *eg*
    - the bad link is not anymore (closes: #48214)
    - update-xaw-wrappers is not needed/called anymore (closes: #24108)
    - another problem with xaw is a non-issue (closes: #26396)
    - We do not care for alternatives vs. xaw-wrappers anymore (closes: #31907)
    - The new xaw-wrappers config format does not tangle us (closes: #37111)
    - Non-existent civclient-xaw will not segfault ;) (closes: #38368)

freeciv (1.9.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabled the building of the freeciv-xaw package because if nobody uses

    a virtual package Provided by the 2 client packages (3 for the CVS
    snapshots). The xaw client is moved to the freeciv-xaw package.

    incompatible)

freeciv (1.7.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed lots of glitches in debianization of the new status quo:
    + We no longer need the "civ" script because we now set datadir in
      configure
    + Made "civ" into an alternative, to cope with future binary packages
      freeciv-xaw3d and freeciv-gtk
    + The menu entry for the client does not point to "civ" anymore but to
      "civclient"; changed the label to state that it's the "(traditional
      Athena version)"
    + Manually stripping binaries till I get around to rewrite debian/rules
      for debhelper
  * Notice: 1.7.2-1 wouldn't work at all, if you have it you need to upgrade
