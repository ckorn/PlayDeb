pushover (0.0.4-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    - profiles so that more than one player can play the game on the same
    computer using the same account
    - 2 solve states. When a level is solved not meeting the time constraint
    it still gets marked as solved, but with a different marker
    - Italian translation (we have up to date translations for Czech, German,
      Spanish and Italian and incomplete translations for French and Russian)
    - 3 new music pieces (only one theme music and a title music is now
    missing)
    - support lua 5.2
    - fixes to typos
    - expect for a proper level solution that dominos don't lean against a
    step this makes level 64 harder, enforced level 64 to play again by
    removing a useless ladder
    - pushover can now quit using the window close button on the window
    header
    - speed-up the fade-in animation when a level is started
    - new type of domino: counter blocker, but with no levels using it, yet
    - improved help window, better suited for translation and improved texts
    for the dominos
    - a few new levels in A&V
    - mission and level names are now translated
    - fix to the background images of 3 dungeon levels
