simgear (2.0.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Quickfix for subtle memory management bug in SimGear, apparently
    not discovered or fixed upstream yet. But it seems to me this
    thing must almost have been working by pure luck all this time...
    Closes: #636121.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 31 Jul 2011 22:43:05 +0200

  * Fixed circular dependencies in debian/sorules that were dropped
    non-deterministically by GNU Make, causing subtle misbuilds.
    Closes: #609439.
  * Note to self: always remember to use pbuilder. Closes: #609511.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 11 Jan 2011 03:50:33 +0100

simgear (2.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Fri, 08 Oct 2010 10:44:32 +0200

simgear (1.9.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated debian/copyright.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 12 Jul 2009 22:21:32 +0200

simgear (1.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated debian/control, sorules, and things for SimGear 1.9.1.
    This includes depending on plib 1.8.5. Closes: #528637, #530638.
  * debian/rules now supports parallellized builds, and building
    out of a svn checkout. It also cleans up a bit better.
  * Added Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Svn fields to debian/control.
  * Converted debian/watch to version 3. Closes: #529139.
  * Added patch to compile with g++ 4.4. Closes: #505019.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 14 Jun 2009 20:38:10 +0200

simgear (1.0.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the pkg-fgfs-crew mailing list the official maintainer of the
    SimGear package, and myself a mere uploader.
  * Updated libglut3-dev build-dependency to freeglut3-dev.
    Closes: #394503.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 21 Jun 2008 12:20:45 +0200

simgear (1.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Homepage field.
  * Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
  * Changed the generated sonames to contain the full version of the
    package, rather than just the major version. (Upstream doesn't care
    about shared libraries and a stable ABI.)
  * Accordingly, renamed the shared-library package to simgear1.0.0,
    and make it conflict with simgear0.
  * Use debian/compat file instead of setting DH_COMPAT in debian/rules.
    Upgraded DH build-dependency and compatibility level to 5.
  * Removed usage of dh_testversion.
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version} in debian/control.
  * Set optimization level according to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Implemented a system to add dependency information to the generated
    .so files, so linking against one of them will pull in whatever else
    is needed from simgear or plib. Because of circular dependencies,
    this isn't perfect, but I think I at least achieved my goal of making
    it possible for stuff to link against SimGear without having to tweak
    makefiles.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 08 Apr 2008 08:42:41 +0200

simgear (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add definitions for Alpha, HPPA, and S/390 to nasal/naref.h,
    thanks to Steve Langasek. This should fix FTBFS on those
    platforms. (Unfortunately, upstream currently doesn't appear
    willing to fix their stuff themselves.) Closes: #461399.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 23 Feb 2008 05:33:40 +0100

simgear (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

simgear (0.3.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the build dependencies for xorg 7.0. Apparently the
    amd64 autobuilder doesn't use Provides. Closes: #366223.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 17 May 2006 17:09:32 -0400

simgear (0.3.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch from Martin Michlmayr for g++ 4.1 build failure.
    Closes: #356606.
  * Build-Depend on libalut-dev, bump flightgear versioned conflict
    (so that a flightgear built with libalut-dev is required too).

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 19 Mar 2006 06:11:36 -0500

simgear (0.3.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * RenderTexture.cpp is updated to revision 1.16 from upstream CVS,
    in order to support DRI (which is not able to render to texture).
    Closes: #348268.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 30 Jan 2006 05:34:32 -0500

simgear (0.3.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, for flightgear 0.9.9.
  * Updated debian/copyright to note that the new
    render-to-texture code is using a BSD-style license
    (which appears to be the zlib/libpng license).
    Also changed it to no longer say that the GPL covers
    a little of this library - it actually covers a lot.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  2 Jan 2006 15:58:09 -0500

simgear (0.3.8-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allright then, if you absolutely insist on a gcc 4.0-compiled
    package before the next upstream release. Mumble.
    Updated Conflicts line to ensure proper flightgear upgrade,
    no source changes. Closes: #319229.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 25 Jul 2005 01:55:18 -0400

simgear (0.3.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 30 Jan 2005 15:27:06 -0500

simgear (0.3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, for flightgear 0.9.5.
  * Upstream seem to have switched to OpenAL.
    Added build dependency on libopenal-dev.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 16 Aug 2004 21:08:52 +0200

simgear (0.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, for flightgear 0.9.4.
  * Changed Build-Depends for new xlibs package layout.
  * Changed Build-Depends to depend on plib1.8.3-dev.
  * Removed MetaKit build-dependency, simgear apparently
    stopped using it in 0.3.4.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed,  7 Apr 2004 10:48:44 +0200

simgear (0.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon,  9 Sep 2002 18:48:40 +0200

simgear (0.0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 27 Mar 2002 21:24:21 +0100

simgear (0.0.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, for flightgear 0.7.9.
    Good, this release don't try to compile metakit on its own anymore.
  * Make sure to conflict with flightgear (<< 0.7.9) to avoid the
    mess I got in the testing distribution last time.
  * Updated copyright file, after discovering that many files are
    marked with a GPL copyright, though the official license is LGPL.
  * Compiled with JPEG image factory support for the heck of it.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 17 Feb 2002 11:56:57 +0100

simgear (0.0.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure that the embedded metakit's configure script is
    not run (it should use the libmetakit-dev I build-depend
    on anyway, not the embedded one).

    I had forgotten.

simgear (0.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * Did some involved stuff in debian/rules to build shared libs
    (upstream sources didn't). At least it looks more elegant than
    plib's method of doing same...
