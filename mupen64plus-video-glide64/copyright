 3DFX GLIDE Source Code General Public License
 .
 1. PREAMBLE
 .
 	This license is for software that provides a 3D graphics application 
 	program interface (API).The license is intended to offer terms similar
 	to some standard General Public Licenses designed to foster open 
 	standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code. Some of these
 	licenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software,
 	any derivative works (that is, new software which is a work containing
 	the original program or a portion of it) must be available for general
 	use, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that
 	the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made 
 	available. The only restriction is that such derivative works must be
 	subject to the same General Public License terms as the original work. 
 .
 	This 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License differs from the
 	standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire
 	derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license
 	nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for
 	the entire derivative work. Rather, the license is limited to only the
 	identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the
 	licensed software. The precise terms and conditions for copying, 
 	distribution and modification follow.
 .
 2. DEFINITIONS
 .
 	2.1 This License applies to any program (or other "work") which 
 	contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be 
 	distributed under the terms of this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General 
 	Public License. 
 .
 	2.2 The term "Program" as used in this Agreement refers to 3DFX's 
 	GLIDE source code and object code and any Derivative Work.
 .
 	2.3 "Derivative Work" means, for the purpose of the License, that 
 	portion of any work that contains the Program or the identifiable 
 	portion of a work that is derived from the Program, either verbatim or
 	with modifications and/or translated into another language, and that 
 	performs 3D graphics API operations. It does not include any other 
 	portions of a work.
 .
 	2.4 "Modifications of the Program" means any work, which includes a
 	Derivative Work, and includes the whole of such work.
 .
 	2.5 "License" means this 3dfx GLIDE Source Code General Public License.
 .
 	2.6 The "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 	for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
 	code means all the source code for all modules it contains, any
 	associated interface definition files, and the scripts used to control
 	compilation and installation of the executable work.
 .
 	2.7 "3dfx" means 3dfx Interactive, Inc.
 .
 3. LICENSED ACTIVITIES
 .
 	3.1 COPYING - You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
 	Program's Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, subject to the
 	provision of section 3.3 and provided also that:
 .
 		(a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
 	an appropriate copyright notice (3dfx Interactive, Inc. 1999), a notice
 	that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Program can
 	only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty as
 	set forth in section 5;
 .
 		(b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
 	to the absence of any warranty; and
 .
 		(c) do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior
 	written permission of 3dfx, and 
 .
 		(d) give all recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 	along with the Program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy
 	of this License.
 .
 	3.2 MODIFICATION OF THE PROGRAM/DERIVATIVE WORKS - You may modify your
 	copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and
 	distribute such modifications subject to the provisions of section 3.3
 	and provided that you also meet all of the following conditions: 
 .
 		(a) you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
 	of a Derivative Work an appropriate copyright notice, a notice that
 	recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the Derivative Work
 	can only do so subject to this License, and a disclaimer of warranty
 	as set forth in section 5;
 .
 		(b) keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and
 	to the absence of any warranty; and
 .
 		(c) give all recipients of the Derivative Work a copy of this
 	License along with the Derivative Work or instructions on how to easily
 	receive a copy of this License.
 .
 		(d) You must cause the modified files of the Derivative Work
 	to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the
 	date of any change. 
 .
 		(e) You must cause any Derivative Work that you distribute or
 	publish to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
 	terms of this License. 
 .
 		(f) You do not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the 
 	prior written permission of 3dfx.
 .
 		(g) If the Derivative Work normally reads commands 
 	interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for
 	such interactive use, to print or display an announcement as follows:
 .
 	"COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THIS 
 	SOFTWARE IS FREE AND PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
 	EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THERE IS NO RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE 
 	TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 3DFX INTERACTIVE, 
 	INC. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A FULL TEXT OF THE
 	DISTRIBUTION AND NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS (REQUEST COPY FROM 
 	INFO@3DFX.COM)."
 .
 		(h) The requirements of this section 3.2 do not apply to the
 	modified work as a whole but only to the Derivative Work. It is not
 	the intent of this License to claim rights or contest your rights to
 	work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
 	right to control the distribution of Derivative Works. 
 .
 	3.3 DISTRIBUTION 
 .
 		(a) All copies of the Program or Derivative Works which are
 	distributed must include in the file headers the following language
 	verbatim:
 .
 	"THIS SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION AND IS OFFERED 
 	ONLY PURSUANT TO THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. THERE IS NO 
 	RIGHT TO USE THE GLIDE TRADEMARK WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION OF 
 	3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. A COPY OF THIS LICENSE MAY BE OBTAINED FROM 
 	THE DISTRIBUTOR OR BY CONTACTING 3DFX INTERACTIVE INC (info@3dfx.com). 
 	THIS PROGRAM. IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
 	EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. SEE THE 3DFX GLIDE GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE FOR A
 	FULL TEXT OF THE NON-WARRANTY PROVISIONS.
 .
 	USE, DUPLICATION OR DISCLOSURE BY THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBJECT TO
 	RESTRICTIONS AS SET FORTH IN SUBDIVISION (C)(1)(II) OF THE RIGHTS
 	IN TECHNICAL DATA AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE CLAUSE AT DFARS 252.227-7013,
 	AND/OR IN SIMILAR OR SUCCESSOR CLAUSES IN THE FAR, DOD OR NASA FAR
 	SUPPLEMENT. UNPUBLISHED RIGHTS RESERVED UNDER THE COPYRIGHT LAWS OF
 	THE UNITED STATES.
 .
 	COPYRIGHT 3DFX INTERACTIVE, INC. 1999, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED"
 .
 		(b) You may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in
 	object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2
 	provided that you also do one of the following: 
 .
 			(1) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
 	machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the 
 	terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2; or,
 .
 			(2) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
 	least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
 	your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 	machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
 	distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on a medium 
 	customarily used for software interchange; or,
 .
 			(3) Accompany it with the information you received as
 	to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
 	is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received
 	the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
 	accord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.)
 .
 		(c) The source code distributed need not include anything
 	that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with
 	the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
 	system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
 	accompanies the executable code.
 .
 		(d) If distribution of executable code or object code is made
 	by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
 	equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts
 	as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 	compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
 .
 		(e) Each time you redistribute the Program or any Derivative
 	Work, the recipient automatically receives a license from 3dfx and
 	successor licensors to copy, distribute or modify the Program and
 	Derivative Works subject to the terms and conditions of the License.
 	You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
 	exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
 	enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
 .
 		(f) You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without 
 	the prior written permission of 3dfx.
 .
 		(g) You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
 	Program or any Derivative Works except as expressly provided under
 	this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
 	distribute the Program or any Derivative Works is void, and will
 	automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
 	parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 	License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 	parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 4. MISCELLANEOUS
 .
 	4.1 Acceptance of this License is voluntary. By using, modifying or
 	distributing the Program or any Derivative Work, you indicate your 
 	acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
 	for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
 	it. Nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
 	Program or Derivative Works and doing so without acceptance of this
 	License is in violation of the U.S. and international copyright laws.
 .
 	4.2 If the distribution and/or use of the Program or Derivative Works
 	is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
 	interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under
 	this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
 	excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
 	or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
 	incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
 	4.3 This License is to be construed according to the laws of the 
 	State of California and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the
 	State of California in the event it is necessary to enforce the
 	provisions of this License.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTIES
 .
 	5.1 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 	FOR THE PROGRAM. OR DERIVATIVE WORKS THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 	OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS"AS IS"
 	WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 	BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
 	FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
 	AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORK IS WITH YOU.
 	SHOULD THE PROGRAM OR ANY DERIVATIVE WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 	THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 	5.2 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL 3DFX
 	INTERACTIVE, INC., OR ANY OTHER COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
 	WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS AS
 	PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
 	SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
 	INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM OR DERIVATIVE WORKS (INCLUDING BUT NOT
 	LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
 	SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM OR
 	DERIVATIVE WORKS TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
 	HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 	DAMAGES.
