 This does not include the name "Red Eclipse" used in the debian packaging which
 falls under a separate license:

 Use of any logos, trademarks, or other advertising/promotional material for
 Red Eclipse are free to use without consent, when used in conjunction with
 a Red Eclipse article, comment, review, advertisement, or redistribution of
 the game; regardless of the media featured in said material. Use for any other
 reason is strictly prohibited without express written consent of Red Eclipse.

 In this case the resulting binary packages and the debian.tar.gz archive are to
 be considered separate instances of "the game" and are redistributable along
 with the "Red Eclipse" name under the following terms:

 Limited rights are granted to redistribute and/or recompress the entire
 distribution using different archival/binary formats suitable for your OS
 (zip/tgz/deb/dmg), any changes beyond that require explicit permission from the
 developers.

 If the "Red Eclipse" name is removed, the contents of debian/* falls completely
 under the Zlib license.
