Source: https://redeclipse.svn.sourceforge.net
 All sourcecode-related items have been removed from the source package, they
 are shipped in the redeclipse source package instead.
 .
 In addition, the files data/trak/trak4/kitchen* have been replaced with links
 to the corresponding files data/trak/trak4/plaster3*, since they use source
 material from CGtextures, whose license and terms of use are extremely iffy,
 these textures are currently not in use in the game.

 > Basically, you can use the fonts for whatever you like, the only restriction
   being that:
 > If the font is a "paid" one, rather than a free one, you should not make the
   .ttf file available to the public.
 > Other than that I'm happy for you use the font however you like.

License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
     pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
     arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
     or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
     work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
     a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
     or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
     below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
     constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
     entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
     each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
     together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the
     purposes of this License.
  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
     of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer
     of ownership.
  d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer
     (s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
     individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
     individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
     in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
     other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
     otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
     (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
     entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
     broadcast.
  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
     this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
     scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
     expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
     dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
     in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
     cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
     analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
     of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional
     work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent
     it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
     or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
     or artistic work.
  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
     communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
     individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means
     or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the
     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast
     the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
     limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and

 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.

 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
     label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
     original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
     work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
     indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
     Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,
     iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
     this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
     the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
     When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
     effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
     Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
     this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
     required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
     the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4
     (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
     to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
     Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
     Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
     reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
     Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
     URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
     Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
     Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
     Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
     however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
     credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
     manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
     by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
     or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
     endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
     appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties.
  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
     derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
     jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
     Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
     deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
     Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
     fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
     make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
     upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
     entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
     License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
     individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
     under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
     License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
     under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
     and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
     to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
     remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
     parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
     extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
     by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
     or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
     shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
     written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
     the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
     1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
     WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
     take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
     sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
     If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
     intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
     pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
     arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
     or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
     work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
     a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
     or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
     below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
     constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
     entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
     each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
     together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the
     purposes of this License.
  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
     http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
     Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
     including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have
     the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
     License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
     works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
     Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
     License.
  d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
     of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer
     of ownership.

     Attribution, ShareAlike.
  f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer
     (s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
     individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
     individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
     in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
     other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
     otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
     (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
     entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
     broadcast.
  h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
     this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
     scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
     expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
     dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
     in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
     cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
     analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
     of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional
     work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent
     it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
     or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
     or artistic work.
  i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
  j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
     communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
     individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means
     or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the
     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast
     the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
  k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
     limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
     reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
     performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
     label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
     original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
     work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
     indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
     Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,
     iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
     this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
     the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
     When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
     effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
     Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
     this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
     required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
     the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
     of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
     License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
     license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
     License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
     (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
     under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
     of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
     the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
     you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the
     Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
     Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
     of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep
     intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
     disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
     Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
     applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
     not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
     subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4
     (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
     to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
     Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
     Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
     reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
     Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
     URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
     Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
     Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
     Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
     however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
     credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
     manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
     by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
     or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
     endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
     appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties.
  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
     derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
     jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
     Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
     deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
     Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
     fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
     make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
     upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
     entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
     License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
     individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
     under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
     License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
     under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
     and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
     to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
     remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
     parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
     extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
     by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
     or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
     shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
     written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
     the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
     1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
     WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
     take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
     sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
     If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
     intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

License: CC-BY-SA-3.0-AU
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE ("LICENCE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
 OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORISED UNDER THIS
 LICENCE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Collection" means the Work in its entirety in unmodified form along with
     one or more other separate and independent works, assembled into a
     collective whole. A Collection may, for example, include a periodical,
     encyclopedia or anthology. A Collection will not be considered a Derivative
     Work for the purposes of this Licence.
  b. "Creative Commons Compatible Licence" means a licence that is listed at
     http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
     Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this Licence,
     including, at a minimum, because that licence:
      i. contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the
         Licence Elements of this Licence; and
     ii. explicitly permits the relicensing of derivatives of works made
         available under that licence under this Licence or a Creative Commons
         jurisdiction licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence.
  c. "Derivative Work" means material in any form that is created by editing,
     modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or the Work
     and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works may, for example, include a
     translation, adaptation, musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or
     any other form in which the Work may be transformed or adapted, except that
     a Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of
     this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
     composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
     timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
     Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.
  d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public by any means, including
     publication, electronic communication, or broadcast.
  e. "Licence Elements" means the following high-level licence attributes
     indicated in the title of this Licence: Attribution, ShareAlike.
  f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer
     (s) the Work under the terms of this Licence.
  g. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
     created the Work.
  h. "Reproduce" means to make a copy of the Work in any material form (eg
     storage in digital form).
  i. "Work" means the material (including any work or other subject matter)
     protected by copyright which is offered under the terms of this Licence.
     This may include (without limitation) a literary, dramatic, musical or
     artistic work; a sound recording or cinematograph film; a published edition
     of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work; or a television or sound
     broadcast.
  j. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this Licence
     who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing and Other Rights
 .
 Nothing in this Licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free
 from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions under copyright
 law or any other applicable laws.
 .
 3. Licence Grant
 .
 3A Grant of Rights
 .
 Provided that the terms set out in this Licence are satisfied, the Licensor
 grants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the following rights:
 .
  a. Reproduce the Work;
  b. incorporate the Work into one or more Collections;
  c. Reproduce the Work as incorporated in any Collection;
  d. create and Reproduce one or more Derivative Works; and
  e. Distribute and publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or the Work as
     incorporated in any Collection.
 .
 3B Media and Formats
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in any media or format whether now known or
 hereafter created. They include the right to make modifications that are
 technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
 .
 3C Other Rights Reserved
 .
 All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved. The Licensor
 waives the right to collect royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
 granted under this Licence.
 .
 4. Restrictions
 .
 The licence granted above is limited by the following restrictions.
 .
 4A Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of the Work
 .
  a. You may Distribute and publicly perform the Work only under the terms of
     this Licence.
  b. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as a
     web link) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
     publicly perform.
  c. You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict this
     Licence or the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
     rights granted to them by this Licence.
  d. You are not granted the right to sublicense the Work. The rights of
     recipients of the Work from You are governed by clause 9.
  e. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the
     disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
     publicly perform.
  f. When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, You must not impose any
     technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient of
     the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by this Licence.
  g. For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A applies to the Work as
     incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material within
     the Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work itself, to be made
     subject to this Licence.
 .
 4B Restrictions on Distribution and Public Performance of Derivative Works
 .
  a. You may only Distribute or publicly perform a Derivative Work if You apply
     one of the following licences to it:
      i. this Licence;
     ii. a later version of this Licence with the same Licence Elements (such as
         Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 Australia); or
     iii. a Creative Commons Unported licence or a licence from another
         jurisdiction (either this or a later version) that has the same Licence
         Elements (such as Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Netherlands); or
     iv. a Creative Commons Compatible Licence.
  b. If You license the Derivative Work under a Creative Commons Compatible
     Licence You must comply with the terms of that licence.
  c. If You license the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licences
     mentioned in clause 4B(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable Licence") You
     must comply with the terms of that licence generally and the following
     provisions:
      i. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (such as
         a web link) for, the Applicable Licence with every copy of the
         Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly perform.
     ii. You must not impose any terms on the Derivative Work that restrict the
         Applicable Licence, or the ability of a recipient of the Derivative
         Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them by that licence.
     iii. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the
         disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
         Derivative Work that You Distribute or publicly perform.
     iv. When You Distribute or publicly perform a Derivative Work You must not
         impose any technological measures on it that restrict the ability of a
         recipient of the Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights
         granted to them by the Applicable Licence.
  d. For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4B applies to any Derivative
     Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other material
     within the Collection, or the Collection as a whole, to be made subject to
     the terms of the Applicable Licence.
 .
 4C Attribution and Notice Requirements
 .
  a. When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or
     Collection You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work.
  b. When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work or any Derivative Work or
     Collection You must provide, in a manner reasonable to the medium or means
     You are using:
      i. the name or pseudonym (if provided) of the Original Author and/or of
         any other party (such as a sponsor institute, publishing entity or
         journal) that the Original Author or Licensor has requested be
         attributed (such as in the copyright notice or terms of use). In this
         clause 4C these parties are referred to as "Attribution Parties";
     ii. the title of the Work (if provided); and
     iii. to the extent reasonably practicable, any Uniform Resource Identifier
         (such as a web link) that the Licensor specifies should be associated
         with the Work that refers to the copyright notice or licensing
         information for the Work.
  c. For any Derivative Work You Distribute or publicly perform, You must take
     reasonable steps to clearly identify that changes were made to the Work.
     For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
     translated from English to Spanish".
  d. In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the above attribution
     should, at a minimum, appear as part of any credits for other contributing
     authors and be as prominent as the credits for those other authors.
  e. You must, to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any
     Collection or Derivative Work if requested to do so by the Licensor or
     Original Author.
  f. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     clause 4C for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above. By
     exercising Your rights under this Licence, You must not assert or imply:
      i. any connection between the Original Author, Licensor or any other
         Attribution Party and You or Your use of the Work; or
     ii. sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor or any
         other Attribution Party of You or Your use of the Work,
     without their separate, express prior written permission.
 .
 4D Moral Rights
 .
 Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognised and
 nonwaivable at law. In this clause 4D, "moral rights" means the personal rights
 granted by law to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example, Part IX
 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) grants authors the right of integrity of
 authorship, the right of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have
 authorship falsely attributed.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
  a. Except as expressly stated in this Licence or otherwise agreed to by the
     parties in writing, and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, the
     Licensor offers the Work "as-is" and makes no representations, warranties
     or conditions of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
     or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, any representations,
     warranties or conditions regarding:
      i. the contents or accuracy of the Work;
     ii. title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose;
     iii. non-infringement;
     iv. the absence of latent or other defects; or
      v. the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable.
  b. The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and
     Territory fair trading legislation, imply certain warranties and conditions
     in certain circumstances, such as the right to supply or fitness for
     purpose of goods or services supplied to a consumer. Clause 5(a) cannot and
     is not intended to exclude, restrict or modify these warranties.
 .
 6. Limit of Liability
 .
  a. To the full extent permitted by applicable law, and except for any
     liability arising from contrary agreement, in no event will the Licensor be
     liable to You on any legal basis (including without limitation, negligence)
     for any loss or damage whatsoever, including (without limitation):
      i. loss of production or operation time, loss, damage or corruption of
         data or records; or
     ii. loss of anticipated savings, opportunity, revenue, profit or goodwill,
         or other economic loss; or
     iii. any special, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages
         arising out of or in connection with this Licence or the use of the
         Work, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
         damages.
  b. If applicable legislation implies warranties or conditions, or imposes
     obligations or liability on the Licensor in respect of this Licence that
     cannot be wholly or partly excluded, restricted or modified, the Licensor’s
     liability is limited, to the full extent permitted by the applicable
     legislation, at its option, to:
      i. in the case of goods, any one or more of the following:
           ☆ the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
           ☆ the repair of the goods;
           ☆ the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring
             equivalent goods;
           ☆ the payment of the cost of having the goods repaired; or
     ii. in the case of services:
           ☆ the supplying of the services again; or
           ☆ the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
  c. The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), and the corresponding State and
     Territory fair trading legislation, restrict the limitation of liability in
     certain circumstances, such as a contract for the supply of goods or
     services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic, or household
     use. Clauses 6(a) and 6(b) cannot and are not intended to apply in
     circumstances where it is prohibited by law.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of the Licence. Individuals
 or entities who have received a Derivative Work or a Collection from You
 pursuant to this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated
 provided they remain in full compliance with those licences. Clauses 1, 2, 5,
 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall survive any termination of this Licence.
 .
 8. Licensor’s Rights Retained
 .
 Subject to the above terms, the Licence granted here is perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding this, the
 Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms
 or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such release will
 not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been granted
 under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force
 and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 9. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work from You
 .
 Each time You Distribute or publicly perform the Work, a Derivative Work or a
 Collection the Licensor offers the recipient a licence to the Work on the same
 terms as are granted to You under this Licence.
 .
 10. Severability
 .
 If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
 law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
 terms of this Licence. Without further action by the parties to this agreement,
 such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
 provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 11. Waivers and Consents
 .
 No term of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
 unless such waiver or consent is in writing and signed by the relevant party.
 .
 12. Entire Agreement
 .
 This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties. To the full
 extent permitted by law, there are no understandings, agreements or
 representations with respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor shall
 not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication
 from You. This Licence may not be modified without the written agreement of the
 Licensor and You.
 .
 13. Governing Law
 .
 The construction, validity and performance of this Licence shall be governed by
 the laws in force in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

License: CC-BY-3.0-US
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
     encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
     with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent
     works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
     constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
     defined below) for the purposes of this License.
  b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
     dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
     art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
     Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
     constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
     a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
     Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
  c. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
     offers the Work under the terms of this License.
  d. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities who
     created the Work.
  e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
     of this License.
  f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
 restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
 the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
     Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
  b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such Derivative
     Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
     clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
     the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
     work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
     indicate "The original work has been modified.";;
  c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the
     Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
  d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
     Derivative Works.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
      i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that
         Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI,
         SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or
         public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
     ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
         agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
         phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
         subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
         US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
  f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
     where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
     collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
     SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
     of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section
     114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
     must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
     License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer
     or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or
     the ability of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to
     that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to
     the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly display,
     publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not
     impose any technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of
     a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
     Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
     Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms
     of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective
     Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a
     Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
     practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
     Section 4(b), as requested.
  b. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as
     defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made
     pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
     and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
     name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/
     or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
     parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
     attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms
     of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties;
     the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable,
     the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
     notice or licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section
     3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the
     Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
     Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in
     any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative
     Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work
     appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
     prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
     avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section
     for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
     exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
     explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
     by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
     appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK
 BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR
 OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
     upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
     entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above)
     or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from You under this
     License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
     individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is

License: Mark-Policy
 THE RED ECLIPSE MARK POLICY
 .
 .
   General Guidelines
 .
 The purpose of the Red Eclipse mark policy is to encourage the widespread use
 of Red Eclipse marks by the community while controlling the use of the marks in
 order to avoid confusion on the part of software users and the general public,
 to maintain the value of the image and reputation of the marks and to protect
 them from inappropriate or unauthorized use.
 .
 Any use of any Red Eclipse mark must be in accordance with this policy. Any use
 that does not comply with our trademark policy is not authorized.
 .
 Marks cover the following items: The name "Red Eclipse", the Red Eclipse emblem
 (without text) and the Red Eclipse logo (with word art text).
 .
 Do not assume that this policy will answer every question about the use of Red
 Eclipse marks, if in doubt, contact the Red Eclipse project.
 .
 .
   Permitted Use
 .
 You may use the marks without prior written permission (subject to the
 following terms):
 .
 1. To refer to the Red Eclipse software in substantially unmodified form.
 .
   "Substantially unmodified" for source code means built from the source code
   provided by The Red Eclipse project, possibly with minor modifications
   including but not limited to: the enabling or disabling of certain features
   bydefault, translations into other languages, changes required for
   compatibility with a particular operating system distribution, the inclusion
   of bug-fix patches, or the bundling of additional extensions.
 .
   "Substantially unmodified" for gameplay and art means using the game data
   provided by The Red Eclipse project, possibly with minor modifications, for
   example including additional maps, artwork, and sounds. The gameplay and art
   needs to closely resemble that of Red Eclipse in it's unmodified form, and
   not create an unfair advantage in gameplay.
 .
   Example: You may modify Red Eclipse to start in windowed mode by default, but
            if you set the gravity in the game to zero, this counts as a
            substantial modification.
 .
   Example: You may modify the laser beams to be green instead of purple, but if
            you change all the weapon models into fresh fruits. this counts as a
            substantial modification.
 .
 2. To identify Red Eclipse as a distinct component of a software offering.
 .
 3. To factually refer to The Red Eclipse project itself, its products, or its
    protocols.
 .
    Example: You may use "Bob's Add-ons for Red Eclipse" or
             "Bob's forum for Red Eclipse" but not "Bob's Red Eclipse".
 .
 4. When referring to Red Eclipse that is not substantially unmodified, to say
    that such software is a "derivative of" or "based on" Red Eclipse. You may
    use the marks as part of the name of a product designed to work with Red
    Eclipse, so long as the name as a whole (via its other components) clearly
    and unambiguously distinguishes the product from Red Eclipse, and the
    general presentation of the product does not imply any official association
    or identity with the Red Eclipse project.
 .
 .
   Non Permitted Use
 .
 You may not use the marks in the following ways:
 .
 1. In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of the Red Eclipse
    project, the origin of its software, or the software's license.
 .
 2. In any way that indicates a greater degree of association between you and
    Red Eclipse project than actually exists.
 .
 3. In any way that implies a designated successor to Red Eclipse
    (e.g., "Red Eclipse++" is not permitted).
 .
 4. In any way that indicates that the Red Eclipse project favours one
    distribution, platform, product, etc. over another except where explicitly
    indicated in writing by the Read Eclipse project.
 .
 Thus uses of the marks in a domain name or company name without explicit
 written permission from the Red Eclipse project are prohibited.
 .
 .
   Other Legal Notes
 .
 The Red Eclipse project reserves the sole right to:
 .
 1. Determine compliance with this policy.
 .
 2. Modify this policy to preserve the rights of Red Eclipse, the public, the
    community, and the users.
    The latest version of the Red Eclipse Mark Policy should be available at
    <http://www.redeclipse.net/wiki/Trademark_Policy>
 .
 3. Grant exceptions to this policy, of any kind and for any reason whatsoever,
    other clauses notwithstanding.
 .
 .
   Other Use
 .
 If you have questions regarding the policy, or if any of the examples are
 unclear, feel free to contact the Red Eclipse project, for example via the
 Red Eclipse forums.
 .
 If you would like to use the Red Eclipse marks for any other use, please
 contact us and we'll discuss a way to make that happen. We don't have strong
 objections to people using the name for their websites and businesses, but we
 do need the chance to review such use.
 .
 In other words, it's not a big deal, and a short conversation (via the forums
 for example) should clear everything up in short order.
 .
 If you currently have a product that is using the Red Eclipse marks in a way
 that don't follow this policy, don't panic. Let us know, and we'll work it out,
 as described above.
