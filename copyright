 Clarification:
 .
 I ("Arand") contacted Ed Merrit (of Ten by Twenty) via email, requesting a
 clarification for the font license and received this response:
 .
 > Hi Arand,
 >
 > Basically, you can use the fonts for whatever you like, the only restriction
   being that:
 > If the font is a "paid" one, rather than a free one, you should not make the
   .ttf file available to the public.
 > Other than that I'm happy for you use the font however you like.
 >

 SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 .
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
 copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
 new environment.
 .
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 .
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
 a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
 redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
 Software, subject to the following conditions:

 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
 in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
 .
 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
 contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
 included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
 in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
 binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 .
 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
 Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
 Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
 presented to the users.
 .

License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
  a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
     pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
     arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
     or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
     work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
     a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work
     in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
     Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
     encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
     or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
     below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
     constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
     entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
     each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
     together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the
     purposes of this License.
  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
     of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer
     of ownership.
  d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer
     (s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
     individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
     individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)
     in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and
     other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or
     otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;
     (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
     entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
     broadcast.
  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
     this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
     scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
     expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
     dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
     in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
     cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
     analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
     assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work
     of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional
     work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent
     it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
     or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
     or artistic work.
  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
     communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
     process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
     performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
     members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
     individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means
     or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the
     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast
     the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
     limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
     reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
     performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
     label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
     original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
     work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
     indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
     Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,
     iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
     this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
     the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
     When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
     effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
     Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
     this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
     required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
     the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4
     (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
     to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
     Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
     Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
     reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
     Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
     URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
     Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
     Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
     Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
     however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
     credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
     manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
     by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
     or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
     endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
     appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties.
  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
     derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
     jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
     Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
     deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
     Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
     fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
     make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
     upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
     entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
     License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
     individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
     under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
     License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
     under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
     and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
     to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
     remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
     parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
     extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
     by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
     or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
     shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
     written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
     the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
     1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
     WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
     take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
     sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
     If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
     intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

     other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
     work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is

  c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
     http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by

     including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have
     the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
     License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
     works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
     Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this

     broadcast.
  h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of

     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
     dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
     in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
     cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process
     analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
     sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are

  i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
     who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
     the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
     exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
  j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to

 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,
 or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
 exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
 under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
     including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
     label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
     original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
     work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
     indicate "The original work has been modified.";
  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
     Collections; and,
  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in

         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the
         exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
         the rights granted under this License;
     ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
         the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
         licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
         to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License; and,
     iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
         royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
         member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
         schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
         granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
     this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
     the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
     under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
     warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
     When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
     effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
     Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
     Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
     this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
     must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
     required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
     notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
     the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
     of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
     License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
     license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
     License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
     (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
     under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
     of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
     the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
     you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the
     Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
     Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
     of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep
     intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the
     disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
     Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b)
     applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
     not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
     subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
  c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4
     (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
     to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original
     Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
     Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
     reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
     Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
     URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
     Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an
     Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation
     (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this
     Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
     however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
     credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
     Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
     manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
     by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
     or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
     endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
     appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
     prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties.
  d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or
     Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
     derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
     Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
     jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
     Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
     deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
     action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
     Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
     fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
     make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
 CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
     upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
     entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
     License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
     individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
     Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
     perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
     Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
     under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
     provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
     License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
     under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
     force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
     and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
     to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
     remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
     parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
     extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
     by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
     respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
     or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
     shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
     communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
     written agreement of the Licensor and You.
  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
     the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
     1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
     WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
     Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
     take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
     sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.
     If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional
     rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
     intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.
