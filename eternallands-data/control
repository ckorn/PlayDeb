Description: Data package for Eternal Lands, a free MMORPG
 Eternal Lands is a FREE MMORPG (massively multi-player online role playing
 game). From the website: The game is now in Beta stage, but that doesn't mean
 it's incomplete. It's currently fully playable and it is constantly worked on
 adding more things to do, more items to make, monsters to fight, and also
 improving the current systems. If you want to help in any way, take a look
 in the forums and there you can post your ideas/suggestions, or perhaps even
 get involved with programming or map making which you can always help with!
