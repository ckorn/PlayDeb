.SH DESCRIPTION
Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments.

The recommended way to change the settings of the client are to edit the config.cfg and init.cfg files. Examples are available in
.IR /usr/share/games/redeclipse/data/examples ,
most options apply to both the client and the server.

.I Warning:
Many of command-line options options will be stored in the init.cfg if used.
