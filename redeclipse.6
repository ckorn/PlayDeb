.SH DESCRIPTION
Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments.
.PP
.B redeclipse
is a script which executes
.BR reclient
from the
.I /usr/lib/games/redeclipse
directory using the "-r" option, it will accept any additional options.
.PP
The recommended way to change the settings of the client are to edit the
.I config.cfg
and
.I init.cfg
files. Examples are available in
.IR /usr/share/games/redeclipse/data/examples/
.PP
The redeclipse client starts a local loopback server upon launch which it uses to connect to, hence many of the server options are accepted by the redeclipse binary as well, to edit the specific settings related to the loopback server, use the
.I localexec.cfg
and
.IR localinit.cfg .
.SH CAVEATS:
Many of these options will, if used, be permanently saved in the init.cfg.

.TP
.BR \-du {0..3}
Set shader quality. 0 for none, 1 for shaders with fastest quality, max is 3. Defaults to 1 where hardware supports it.
.IP
