.SH DESCRIPTION
Red Eclipse is a single-player and multi-player first-person ego-shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself toward a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments.
.PP
.B redeclipse
is a script which executes
.BR redeclipse
from the
.I /usr/lib/games/redeclipse
directory using the "\-r" option, it will accept any additional options.
.PP
The recommended way to change the settings of the client are to edit the
.I config.cfg
and
.I init.cfg
files in the home directory.
.PP
The redeclipse client starts a local loopback server upon launch which it uses to connect to for singleplayer, hence many of the server options are accepted by the redeclipse binary as well (see
.BR redeclipse-server (6)).
To edit the specific settings related to the loopback server, use the
.I localexec.cfg
and
.I localinit.cfg
files in the home directory.
.SH CAVEATS
Many of these options will, if used, be permanently saved in the init.cfg file.
