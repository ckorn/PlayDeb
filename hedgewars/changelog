      (the newly added missions use it)
    + More helpful syntax error messages.

      configured. the parameter contains the parameter(s) as text string
      onPreviewInit() -- called during map preview initialization
      onGearWaterSkip(gearUid) -- called when a gear skims the water without

      DismissTeam(teamname) -- removes a team from the game (note: if you used
      loc() on teamnames, don't forget to the translated teamname here too)

      PlaceSprite(x, y, sprite, frameIdx [, landFlag, ... ]) -- sprite

      SetWeapon(ammoType) -- decide which weapon the current hedgehog should
      equip
    + Map Drawing:
      -- to be used in onGameInit() -- first set MapGen to mgDrawn and then use
      the commands below
      AddPoint(x, y [, width [, erase] ]) -- takes x,y location, a width (means
      start of a new line) and erase (if line should erase, not draw)
      FlushPoints() -- makes sure that all the points/lines specified using the
      command above are actually applied to the map
    + New global enumerations:
      Mapgens: mgRandom, mgMaze, mgPerlin, mgDrawn
      TSprite values
      LandFlags: lfIndestructible, lfIce, lfBouncy
    + Changed functions:
      HogSay(gearUid, text, manner [, vgState]) -- now also allows you to make
      NON-Hedgehog gears speak, e.g. barrels... wait what?!
    + Changed hooks:
      onHogAttack() can now be hooked with new parameter:
      onHogAttack(ammoType) - to conveniently find out which ammo/weapon
      is being used
    * Fixes:
      gfResetHealth is now a available like the other GameFlags

    + New theme: Fruit
    + Cool New Weapons: Freezer
    + We've improved your existing arsenal, too! The 'size' of cleaver has been
      reduced, so now it's more likely to cut into hogs instead of imbedding
      itself infuriatingly into the ground. The Flying Saucer has also seen some
      interesting changes...
    + Death comes from below!
      It's time to take your amphibious assault to the next level.
      While using the Flying Saucer, it's now possible to launch projectiles
      from underwater!
      Also, instead of just dropping bombs on your enemies you can aim
      them, too! Wow!
    + Improved AI
      The newly improved AI can use drill-rockets!
    + New Gameplay Challenges
      A frenetic, awesome new gameplay mode: Frenzy! In this mode each turn
      lasts only one second.
    + An extra mission: Nobody Laugh.
    + More Achievements: 'Prestigious Pilot' and 'Naughty Ninja' have been added
      to the old missions. Have fun trying to unlock them.
    + A new weaponset, One of Everything.
    + New Maps
      Fight on a variety of new battlegrounds!
      New entries include Bones, Crystal, Grassy, Haunty, Oaks,
      Shrooms and Tentacles!
    + More customization!
      Over 30 new hats!
      New SteelTower fort!
    + Ropers Rejoice
      Now you can play on an 'infinite' number of procedurally generated maps,
      thanks to the new Shoppa Map script.
    + Much improvements in the behavior of rope in 0.9.18.

    + Built using the -3 upstream tarball hedgewars-src-0.9.18-3.tar.bz2
    + Hedgewars now has a campaign! This was a GSoC project.
    + Another GSoC project, video recording! Use the 'r' key to start/stop
      recording video. Video management is on the frontpage.
    + PNG screenshots, to make sharing screenshots more convenient.
    + New weapons! The meat cleaver is the latest addition.
      Cleavers work well for climbing or blocking entrances.
    + The AI is now a lot more evil. Set it to maximum level to get the full
      effect. It knows how to use cake, sniper rifle and kamikaze, as well
      as aiming shots to drown hedgehogs or do fall damage. It has also gotten
      more effective at a number of existing weapons, and can move around the
      map more intelligently.
    + Drawn maps now have variable pen width, and an eraser tool.
      Note that the eraser does increase the size of the drawn map network
      traffic, so don't use it as a substitute for undo.
    + Static maps no longer have size limits. Please use this sanely, since not
      everyone has a machine with 16 gigs of memory like you do.
    + New missions such as portal and rope training.
    + Customised team colours! Check the advanced tab in team config.
