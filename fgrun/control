 When selecting an aircraft you are able to view a complete 3d model and see

 launch from you can chose either by the ICAO ID (International Civilian
 Aviation Organisation Identifier) or the airport id, with the flexibility of
 selecting a runway and parking position also.

 When launching the simulation FGRun includes a comprehensive configuration
 system, allowing you to directly configure settings such as screen resolution
 and multiplayer settings.

 FGRun also includes support for TerraSync, a tool included with FlightGear
 that allows you to download and use scenery while in the simulation, it can
 also preload the scenery for your selected location as the airport selection
 screen.
