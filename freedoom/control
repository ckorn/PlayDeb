Description: multiplayer-oriented maps for Doom
 Freedoom is a project to create a complete Doom II-compatible IWAD file
 which is Free Software.
 .
 FreeDM is a sub-project to create a set of levels designed for deathmatch
 play.
 .
 FreeDM does not require Freedoom to play and can be used in conjunction
 with a boom-engine. Please note that this is designed for multiplayer and
 will not be of much use for single player.

Description: free game files for the 3D game DOOM
 Freedoom is a project to create a complete Doom engine-based game which is
 free software, in addition to maintaining compatibility with Doom
 modifications ("mods") that have been released by the continually-active
 community since 1993.
 .
 Freedoom aims to create "IWAD" files for the engine, each of these
 is an independent sub-project representing different aims towards game
 design and compatibility with Doom mods:
 .
 Freedoom: Phase 1 - A four-chapter game, nine levels each,
 totalling 36 levels. This project aims for compatibility
 with The Ultimate Doom (also known as plain Doom or Doom 1).
 .
 Freedoom: Phase 2 - A 32-level chapter featuring extra monsters
 and a double-barrelled shotgun. This project aims for
 compatibility with Doom II.
 .
 Combined with any boom compatible Doom engine (such as prboom)
 this will result in a complete Free Doom-based game.

Description: all Freedoom IWAD files
 Freedoom is a project to create a complete Doom engine-based game which is
 free software, in addition to maintaining compatibility with Doom
 modifications ("mods") that have been released by the continually-active
 community since 1993.
 .
 Freedoom aims to create three "IWAD" files for the engine, each of these
 is an independent sub-project representing different aims towards game
 design and compatibility with Doom mods:
 .
 Freedoom: Phase 1 - A four-chapter game, nine levels each,
 totalling 36 levels. This project aims for compatibility
 with The Ultimate Doom (also known as plain Doom or Doom 1).
 .
 Freedoom: Phase 2 - A 32-level chapter featuring extra monsters
 and a double-barrelled shotgun. This project aims for
 compatibility with Doom II.
 .
 FreeDM - 32 levels designed for competitive deathmatch play.
 .
 This package will install all three IWAD files in
 /usr/share/games/freedoom-iwads. It is independent from other packages
 and will install only the IWAD files. It has no other dependencies and
 doesn't conflict with any other packages. Its intention is to use the
 files in other Doom engines without installing Boom through the
 dependencies.
