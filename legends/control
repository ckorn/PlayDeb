Description: Fast-paced FPS online multiplayer game (i386 only)
 Legends is a fast-paced first-person-perspective
 online multiplayer game released as freeware.
 The game is designed to take advantage of the
 beautiful environments available from the Torque
 engine it is based on, while still offering the
 breakneck pacing and variety of styles available
 from such classics as Quake and Tribes. 
 .
 Gameplay is not the strafe-strafe-jump-strafe
 -shoot-strafe-run-like-hell style a
 lot of games espouse; the addition of a jetpack
 adds a third dimension of mobility that makes skill,
 forethought, and restraint necessities to winning.
