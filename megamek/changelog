megamek (0.39.1-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    v0.39.1 (2014-08-26 14:56 UTC)
    + Patch [#458]: Highlighting FOV options
    + Patch [#462]: Forcing redirected system.out and sys.err to respect
    flush
    + Data: New Images and some date fixes
    + Added entity attribute neverDeployed to the MUL files
    + Bug [#4189] Princess throws NPE (in exp branch)
    + Feature [#1269]: Allow changing button order for phase displays
    + Feature: Added an FPS counter that is toggleable via advanced options
    + Data: Unit Fixes and New Images.
    + Data: New Images.
    + Data: Starting to change Source Names to match TRO for easier
    reference.
    + Bug [#4193]: Princess NPE: Exception in thread "Packet Pump"
    java.lang.NullPointerException
    + Feature: Added the font_color attribute to the UI_Element tag in skin
    specs
    + Feature: Plain skin; now if an icon for a border or button fails to
    load, the element falls back to the paintComponent method of its parent,
    which enables a plain skin to be specified by leaving out all icons.
    + Feature: Added ability to select a skin specification file in the
    client settings dialog. Note: this only takes effect before a game is 
    started
    + Feature: SkinSpecification/MegamekBorder now supports a no border mode
    + Feature: SkinSpec/MegamekButton now supports scaled background images
    in addition to tiled ones
    + Bug [#4190]: Nova/Watchdog CEWS projects a 6 hex ECM field instead of 3
    + Data: New Images,Unit Fixes, and RAT fixes
    + Bug [#4199]: Movement impossible due to infinite recursion/stack
    overflow
    + Better error handling for skin selection: in the client dialog it will
    check to see if the skin file failed to load and if so notify the user
    and reinit the old skin. Error logging for failed parsing is also better. 
    Finally, if a SkinSpecification is requested when no SkinSpec is
    initialized, a default value is returned that will effectively force a
    "plain" skin.
    + Refactored BoardView1 to move it to its own package and refactored a
    lot of inner classes to their own classes/files.
    + Rewrote BoardView1.drawMinefields(): now instead of iterating through
    all visible coords, it iterates through all mined coords and checks to see
    if they are visible.
    + Adjusted default values for ADVANCED_KEY_REPEAT_DELAY and
    ADVANCED_KEY_REPEAT_RATE
    + Bug [#4196]: Princess Fires on Crew Killed Vehicles
    + Bug [#4203]: Poor indication when aeros are low or out of fuel
    + Bug [#4201]: Initiative Issues with mek/vee lance and inf/proto move
    multi options
    + Data: New Images
    + Data: Part 2 of Source Name change to match TRO for easier reference.
    + Bug: Flare rounds missing from Mutators.
    + Feature: Added flare sprites, to indicate the locations of flares
    + Patch [#460]: Merged changes from experimental: New shortest path
    finders + Longest path finder + fixed bug with jump movement envelope.
    + Bug [#4204]: Game.addEntity allows adding of duplicate Entity IDs
    + Feature: Added maximal movement modifiers envelope.
    + Bug: movement envelope and movement modifiers sprites not scaling when
    changing zoom levels
    + Data: New Images and some equipment date/name fixes.
    + Fix: Faster path finding for aeros on ground.(Longest path still takes
    >20sec)
    + Data: New Images
    + Feature: Smarter path finding for Princess
    + Data: New Images
    + Bug: Princess violates stacking restrictions
    + Bug: Windows does not allow double quotes in filenames, so fluff images
    for any unit that has a model using them will not work. Fixed by stripping
    the double quotes from the models of such units, allowing the filenames to
    be exact without them. Example:
    Unit: Grasshopper GHR-7K "Gravedigger"
    Fluff Filename: Grasshopper GHR-7K Gravedigger.gif
    + Data: New Images and some unit fixes. Includes additional wreck images.
    + Data: New Images and fix for bug [#4209]
    + Bug: Added a new game event: GameVictoryEvent, which has a corresonding
    GameListener.gameVictory method. This event is called when the
    PHASE_VICTORY is ending, but before Game.reset is called. This fixes a
    bug with MekHQ (and likely MekWars as well)
    + Bug: NPE in princess precognition when after a mechwarrior is picked by
    a mech
    + Data: New Images
    + PlayerSettingsDialog now displays the name of the player being
    configured
    + Server sends a chat to all players when a player changes their
    player-wide initiative bonus
    + PlayerSettingsDialog can now be accessed mid-game so that players can
    adjust their settings, like player-wide initiative bonus. This is to help
    support conditional initiative bonuses, like in Total Chaos
    + Feature [#1264]: Display proper probabilities with Natural Aptitude:
    Gunnery
    + Feature [#1270]: RFE: Please add simple Pilot data to MechDialog
    + Bug [#4207]: Aero fighters lose ability to take off once landed
    + Feature [#1198]: View last round's report option (View -> Round Report
    now displays previous rounds as well as the current round)
    + Feature [#1199]: Make addbot default to princess bot
    + Feature [#1271]: Unofficial Heavy Wood PSR should not apply to
    Inf/BA/Protos
    + Feature [#1197]: Random Army Dialog remembers settings (except selected
    RAT)
    + Feature [#1197]: Random Army Dialog remembers selected RAT
    + Data: New Images - So ends DBs NBP Project Pt#1
    + Bug: Ortho graphic icons (bridges) drawn too low when on negative
    elevation
    + Bug: Princess.die could throw an NPE
    + Bug: CustomMechDialog getNextEntity(boolean) returning entities for
    other players
    From a discussion with Arlith, we decided that perhaps this was intended
    if no blind drop options are on. However, we also decided to limit it to the
    units owned by the player of the currently displayed units so that you will
    only cycle through the entities of one player at a time
    + Bug: BattleMaster BLR-1G and "chassis" not working quite right due to
    misnamed files
    + Bug: NPE in MtfFile.java when the file that is being parsed is empty
    + Feature [#1158]: Map Editor: Re-size maps
    + Refactored Compute.get*ECMFieldSize() methods to be cleaner and a bit
    more efficient
    + Updated Game to cache which Coords have Entitys in them, and what those
    Entitys are. Now Game.getEntities(Coords) uses the cache to return much
    quicker. This is important for games with a large number of Entitys, as
    Game.getEntities(Coords) can be called frequently (like when computing
    LoS)
    + Bug: View -> Round Report was displaying the phase report for the
    current round instead of the round report
    + Bug [#4215]: Long delays between turns for large battles with
    double-blind/sensors
    + Bug [#4213]: Deployment Not Following Initiative Options
    + Feature [#1147]: Simultaneous Deployment Option
    See the simultaneous_move_deploy.txt in the docs folder
    + Feature [#1192]: Simultaneous movement
    See the simultaneous_move_deploy.txt in the docs folder
    + Bug [#4194]: Hang in Firing Phase When Using Battle Armor with
    Non-Standard AP
    Weapon (v39.0)
    + Bug: RandomSkillDialog hides player selection combo box with long
    player names
    + Bug: Mek/Vee lance rules not working in deployment phase
    + Bug: NPE in RandomArmyDialog if no RAT is selected
    + Data: New Images and RATs for Steiner 2765 (Start of DBNDPII)
    + Bug [#4217] Vedette (Standard) appears in Xotl tables as Vedette (AC2)
    + Bug [#4218]: J. Edgar displaying wrong in Unit List
    + Bug: Simultaneous Deployment not working because of missing code in
    Client.java
    + Bug [#4219]: Issues with stacking violations and MovePaths (Temporary
    Hack Fix)
    + Bug [#4220]: Client issues with Load and LocalLoad Commands
    + Bug: SocketException: Broken Pipe when disconnecting from server
    + Bug [#4224]: Client still thinks an Entity is in the dest hex during
    movement phase
    + Feature: Natural Aptitude Piloting
    + Feature [#1237]: Save/Load game settings in Megamek
    + Added consideration for Natural Aptitude Piloting & Gunnery to Princess
    (I think I got it all)
    + Data: New Images, Osteon Fix, Wreck Set Fix and RAT fixes
    + Added consideration for Natural Aptitude Piloting & Gunnery to TestBot
    + Bug: Simultaneous Movement/Deployment unit selected resetting when
    other player deploys
    + Bug: Simultaneous Deployment stacking violations from units moving when
    another hex is clicked
    + Refactored MechDisplay to UnitDisplay to better reflect that we have
    more unit types
    + Bug: Fixing missing l10n entry: InfantryMapSet.ArmorXXXXXXXXXXXX (the
    entry being looked for was wrong)
    + Bug [#4194]: BA APmounts specified in MULs could cause a crash
    + Bug [#4226]: Long delays between phases for large battles with
    double-blind/sensors
    + Bug: NPE when selecting C3 choices for masters in unit customization
    dialog
    + Bug: Loading a MUL file with specified C3 networks caused doubling or
    slave Entities, and C3 networks were not connected
    + Bug: Compute.inVisualRange wasn't considering SO Advanced AA fire
    + Bug [#4228]: VTOLs Invalid Targets for ASF on Map
    + Bug: updated ECM drawing code to not draw EC(C)M fields for transported
    units (according to current errata)
    + Bug [#4227]: VTOL Turrets do not show in MM Unit Display
    + Feature [#1279]: Introduction of custom quirks file
    + Data: New Images
    + Added the following new quirks: Battle Fists, Overhead Arms, Compact
    Mech, Low-Mounted Arms, Oversized and Static Ammo Feed. None of these are
    coded yet, they are purely display values only. Also updated the 
    cannonUnitQuirks.xml file to include these new quirks
    + Feature Request [features:#1265] Princess Bot and magma
    + Added code to make Princess fire hole-punchers before crit-seekers
    + Added new unofficial option to ignore TW pg. 109 rules requiring
    primary targets being in front arc
    + Bug: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Princess's
    PathRanker.validatePaths()
    if the list of paths to validate is empty to begin with
    + Refactored Entity.getDamageLevel() and associated methods to allow for
    a boolean flag checkCrew so that crew life checking can be ignored
    + Bug [#4233]: IllegalStateException From LongestPathFinder.
    + Bug: Fixed a few things with VGL submunitions, allow them to be
    selectable, however VGLs are still non-functional
    + Bug: Smoke does not dissapate unless TO starting fires is on
    + Feature: Updated UI to handle weapons that have automatic targets (like
    vehicular grenade launchers)
    + Feature: Vehicular grenade launchers now report as auto-hits
    + Bug: Fixed stack overflow with UI automatic target code
    + Added support for a new Smoke type: Chaff, to be used for VGL chaff
    grenades
    + Refactored code relating to SmokeCloud, including replacing magic
    numbers with static final values in SmokeCloud
    + Bug: Princess FireControl was using the smoke level directly to compute
    to-hit penalties, since smoke level doesn't directly correspond to
    light/heavy, this wasn't quite accurate. Fixed the code and expanded the
    firecontrol unit tests to incorporate tests for other smoke levels
    + Bug: data/images/hexs/trasparent/lismoke.png should be lismokes.gif
    + Updated hex tilesets to include a chaff icon, just used light smoke
    icon as a placeholder
    + Bug: Communications equipment always generating ECCM, regardless of
    mode
    + More support for Chaff: chaff now considered as ECM that effects all
    players
    + Server now updates client's list of smoke clouds: added a new packet
    type, this is required because chaff type SmokeClouds generate ECM, which
    the client needs to know about
    + ECMInfo now supports having a null owner, which indicates that it
    should always be considered as coming from an enemy
    + Feature [#1281]: Implement vehicular grenade launcher ammo
    functionality
    + Updated VGL Ammo names, default ammo name has Fragmentation in it
    + Changed UnitDisplay so that the ammo dropdown displays the name of the
    ammo for one-shot weapons, the combo box remains disabled
    + Bug: Missing break statements in Mech.decodeCritical, causing VGLs to
    write out incorrectly
    + Bug: BLKMechFile VGL parsing out of sync with Mtf.parseCrits
    + Updated Mounted.getDesc() to add in the facing for VGLs
    + Updated BLKFile.loadEquipment to handle parsing facing for VGLs, also
    updated various overrides for other applicable units
    + Bug [#4235]: ECM Effects being summed instead of maxed across multiple
    hexes
    + Bug [#4235]: ECM Range using < instead of <=
    + Bug [#4230]: ECM strength and ECCM strength now tracked separately in
    ECMInfo
    + Bug: ECCM no longer effects Stealth armor, per errata
    + Bug [#4229] ECCM covering the source of an ECM field should negate the
    ECM field
    + Data: New Images/Unit Fixes few new Camos.
    v0.39.0 (2014-07-02 21:14 UTC)

    + Bug [#4154]: WarShip docking bug (minor)
    + Bug [#4146]: Aeros can no longer select munition types for LB-X
    (errata)
    + TestAero will now mark Aeros with special munitions are illega
    (errata), except for cluster munitions on LB-X's (can only use cluster), and
    artemis capable munitions for Artemis-linked launchers. NARC, MMLs and ATMs
    are exempt
    + Bug [#4148]: bug in dfa hitting water
    + Bug [#4168]: Careful movement penalties should not apply to jump/VTOL
    MP
    + Bug [#4171]: Erroneous "C3 Network Too Big" message with 12 'Mechs
    networked
