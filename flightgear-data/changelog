flightgear-data (3.4.0+dfsg-0~exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Florent Rougon ]
  * New upstream release 3.2 (Closes: #766251).
  * Remove 766251.patch which is not necessary anymore.
  * Adjust dependencies on flightgear.
  * Drop the obsolete dummy packages fgfs-*.
  * debian/rules: replace "find ... -exec {} \;" with
    "find ... -execdir '{}' +" for more efficiency when calling chmod on
    many files.
  * Drop the obsolete debian/links file (link from
    /usr/share/doc/fgfs-base/Docs to /usr/share/games/FlightGear/Docs).

  [ Markus Wanner ]
  * New upstream almost-release 3.4, tagged 3.4.0~rc99 to avoid confusion
    with the eventual real 3.4.0 (Closes: #776913, #760698, #760077,
    #760083).
  * Drop patch translation-update-pt.diff, it got applied upstream.
  * Drop references to Textures.high from d/rules. These directories
    no longer exist. Add the new webgui.
  * Update debian/copyright and debian/watch.
  * Repack upstream's tarball: remove jquery, flot and leaflet from
    webgui's 3rdparty. Also strip the unneeded copies of tzdata and the
    liberation font.
  * Add the necessary JavaScript dependencies, instead. Add patch
    use-system-jslibs.diff to deal with the version-less jquery file
    name of libjs-jquery.
  * Add missing-sources for the sprintf js library.
  * Bump S-V: no changes needed.
  * Update the watch file.
  * Use dh_link rather than the former dance in postinst/prerm. Drop
    these two for flightgear-data-base.
  * Drop another unnecessary LICENSE file.
