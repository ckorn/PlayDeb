Description: Client package for Eternal Lands, a free MMORPG 
 Eternal Lands is a free to play, graphical MMORPG (massively-multi-player
 online role-playing game).  Different from other role-playing games, there are
 no fixed classes so you can improve any of the many skills.  There is a choice
 of several character races but all are equal.
