  * New upstream version
    * Axes have a cleaving attack, hitting up to 7 enemies around you.
    * The Vaults branch is five levels deep, with a distinct layout and
    several new
      types of guards.
    * Abyss has multiple levels of increasing difficulty, more varied
    terrain, and
      many new thematic monsters.
    * Conjurers get a new starting book of offensive non-elemental spells.
    * Beogh and Yredelemnul let you recall allies across dungeon levels.
    * Major changes to Vehumet.

    * Secret doors are no more.

    Branches, environment
    ---------------------
    * The Hall of Blades layout has been adjusted, and now contains two
    weapons
      with "interesting brands" instead of just one.
    * The Abyss is revamped yet again. It now contains five (still infinite)
      levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with
      different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The rune
      appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper
      levels.
    * The Abyssal rune always appears in a vault, never lying around on the
    floor.
    * Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss
    exits.
    * Many Ziggurat floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few
    monster
      sets have been replaced entirely.
    * Three new Sprint maps: "Thunderdome" by evilmike, "The Pits" and "Arena
    of
      Blood" both by st.
    * The Abyss no longer exists in Sprint.
    * New layouts for Cocytus, Gehenna, Snake, and the main Dungeon.
    * More layouts allowed in Zot.
    * New Lair branch ending vaults, and many other new vaults.
    * More decorative vaults are now placed.
    * "Special rooms" (kobold/orc rooms, beehives, morgues, jelly pits) have
    been
      adjusted, now appear at more appropriate depths and layouts, and no
      longer
      place doors.
    * A new "special room" - the mythical zoo, with standard high fantasy
    beasts.
    * New "runed door" feature: won't be opened by auto-explore or by
    monsters.
      Becomes a regular door when opened.
    * Alarm traps only trigger once, but make monsters swarm towards you for
    some
      time.

    Character
    ---------
    * Stalker is removed.
    * Berserkers may choose their starting weapon.
    * Gladiator no longer starts with a buckler, gets more Dodging to
    compensate.
    * Traps are spotted (or not) deterministically based on skill level and a
      few other factors: spending more time does not help.
    * Levitation and controlled flight are no more - all flight is
    controlled.
    * Flying no longer increases carrying capacity.
    * Tengu receive their movement speed bonus when flying, regardless of
    burden.
    * Black draconians gain permanent flight (like Tengu but without the
    speed
      boost) at XL 14.
    * Removed the hidden special cost of Spellcasting, Stealth, Evocations
    and
      Invocations. Aptitudes adjusted.
    * Experience aptitude uses the same scale as skill aptitudes. This scale
    is
      coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or
      less
      experience to gain levels than before.
    * Deep Elves are better at Earth magic than Air.
    * Hill Orcs are better at Axes, worse at gaining levels.
    * Tengu are better at gaining levels.
    * Levels 1 and 2 of the teleportitis mutation teleport you only a limited
      distance.
    * The augmentation and powered by pain Demonspawn mutations have been
    improved.

    Monsters
    --------
    * Removed: ant larvae, bumblebees, blessed toes, rock trolls, wood
    golems.
    * New monster: moth of suppression. Generates an aura that prevents
    evocation
      and suppresses the magical effects of wielded/worn equipment.
    * New abyssal monsters:
        - Wretched star: bestows temporary mutations.
        - Tentacled starspawn: has constricting tentacles and a nasty attack.
        - Ancient zyme: causes sickness when near the player.
        - Lurking horror: stalks like a wandering mushroom, then explodes for
          torment.
        - Starcursed mass: proliferates when ignored, re-merges when damaged.
          Has a smite-targeted psychic scream that becomes more powerful as
          more masses become visible.
        - Apocalypse crab: breathes clouds of chaos.
        - Thrashing horror: moves like a bat, tramples, and frenzies.
        - Spatial maelstrom: incorporeal vortex that turns walls into spatial
          vortices.
    * New deep troll specialist monsters, appearing in late-D deep troll
    packs:
        - Deep troll shamans: cast Might Other and Haste Other on their
          accompanying deep troll packs.
        - Deep troll earth mages: cast Dig and LRD to allow the rest of the
        deep
          troll pack to pursue their opponent.
    * New vaults monsters:
        - Vault sentinels, with a signal horn that generates a lot of noise
        and
          the Sentinel's Mark spell which alerts all creatures on the level
          to
          the player's location.
        - Vault wardens, with the ability to close and seal doors near the
        player
          for a time or until they are killed.
        - Ironbrand convokers, with the ability to recall other monsters on
        the
          level to their location. Also cast Might Other.
        - Ironheart preservers, with the ability to take some damage in place
        of
          an enemy the player is currently attacking.
    * New uniques:
        - Jorgrun, a deep dwarven earth elementalist.
        - Lamia, queen of the nagas.
    * Friendly summoned monsters do not attack things unless the player has
    line
      of sight to both the summon and the victim. Glass does not count as
      line of
      sight for this purpose.
    * Summoned monsters do not cast spells that create permanent allies.
    * Only a select few monsters flee at low HP.
    * Ereshkigal has more HP, and can now cast Silence and Major Healing.
    * Changed monsters: Frances, Joseph, Polyphemus, bone dragons, soul
    eaters,
      vampires, vampire knights.
    * Rotting corpses no longer spawn toadstools for non-Fedhasites.
    * Monsters can now use wands of digging, and cast Dig in more
    circumstances.

    Spells
    ------
    * Removed: Fulsome Distillation, Evaporate, Cigotuvi's Degeneration, See
      Invisible and Insulation.
    * New spells:
        - Force Lance (level 2 Conjuration). Fires a short-range
        single-target
          projectile that can knock monsters backwards.
        - Dazzling Spray (level 3 Conjuration/Hexes). Fires a spread of
        energy
          bolts that can blind creatures.
        - Iskenderun's Battlesphere (level 4 Conjuration/Charms). Creates an
          autonomous globe that shoots at enemies in sync with your
          conjurations.
        - Fulminant Prism (level 5 Conjuration/Hexes). Creates a time bomb at
        a
          smite-targetted location.
        - Disjunction (level 8 Translocation). Has a duration, during which
        it
          blinks away nearby monsters. Causes contamination.
    * Conjurers have a new book with non-elemental spells (including the new
      conjurations).
    * Spell memorisation failure is no more. As long as the failure chance is
      not 100%, the spell can be memorized. There is a warning prompt if the
      chance of a miscast is high.
    * Some spellbooks have been reorganized.
    * Condensation Shield's SH bonus no longer cares about Shields skill or
      intelligence.
    * The blinking component of the Dispersal spell is irresistible.
    * Venom Bolt and Bolt of Magma do more damage; Teleport Other works more
    often.
    * Recall is now gradual instead of instant: one ally is recalled every
    3-6
      aut.

    Items
    -----
    * Axes have a cleaving attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single
      swing (all directions except directly opposite the direction of attack,
      but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75%
      damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is
      reduced
      to compensate.
    * One-handed maces and flails have been improved: flails and eveningstars
    get
      a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1
      damage/accuracy
      boost to replace spiked flails.
    * The wand of polymorph other is now the wand of polymorph; use of it
    against
      the player will turn them into a random form (including several new
      forms -
      tree form, wisp form, porcupine form and fungus form).
    * Scroll of unholy creation is replaced with scroll of summoning, which
      summons a few level-appropriate monsters.
    * Removed items: spiked flail, potion of water, staff of enchantment,
    plain
      (non-magic, non-quarter-) staves
    * Potion of decay rots HP immediately rather than giving the "Rot"
    status.
    * Potions and rings of levitation are now "of flight"; boots of
    levitation
      are now "of flying"; and the +Lev artefact property is now +Fly.
    * Amulet of controlled flight is removed; Amulet of the Air now grants
      passive Repel Missiles and inaccuracy instead.
    * Amulet of inaccuracy correctly affects ranged weapons.
    * Amulet of clarity prevents mesmerisation.
    * Some rods were changed to have a more focused spell set.
    * The "Contam" artefact property no longer causes contamination over
    time,
      but only when the item is unequipped.
    * The "*Rage" artefact property triggers much less often (except for
    Wrath of
      Trog).
    * Improved fixedarts: Spear of the Botono, Robe of Night, Cloak of the
    Thief,
      Robe of Folly, plutonium sword.
    * The hand-and-a-half weapon category is gone; such weapons are now
      one-handed for normal-size races.

    Gods
    ----
    * Followers of worshippers of Beogh and Yredelemnul can now be recalled
    across
      levels.
    * Followers of Beoghites now share experience when the player scores
    kills.
    * Yredelemnul gives a small amount of piety for desecrating holy remains.
    * Vehumet is overhauled: Now grants damaging spells one-at-a-time
    (available
      from the (M)emorization screen), partially based on your elemental
      skills.
      No longer supports summoning, accepts ally kills, or reduces spell MP
      cost.
    * Zin's Imprisonment placement is much more forgiving, pushing adjacent
      monsters out of the way if possible.
    * Lugonu's Enter the Abyss no longer reduces maximum HP or MP.
    * Lugonu no longer gives piety for anything in the Abyss.
    * Mobile Fedhas-granted allies follow you across levels en masse.
    * New Xom effects: loud noises, blink monsters, enchant monster (petrify,
      slow, paralysis, enslavement; haste, might, invisibility), summon
      shadow
      creatures.
    * Xom does not reduce stats as drastically, unless bored.
    * Xom will not animate or swap weapons in the Abyss, and will not
    hostilely
      animate your weapon at all anymore.

    Interface
    ---------
    * Many updated tiles.
    * A new Android port with touch-screen support.

      out-of-range monster before falling back to the player's position,
      but will ignore plants.

    by
      prefixing it with "@".
    * Swap the cycle ammunition commands. '(' = backward, ')' = forward.
