stone-soup (0.13.0-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * A new race: Gargoyles.
    * A reimagined Skald background.
    * A thorough rework of the monster set in Crypt.
    * Improvements to many evokable items.
    * A new item: sack of spiders.
    * Massively overhauled layout generators.
    * Summoning school: per-spell limits and no stair following or pulling.
    * New Sprint map: linesprint.

    Branches, environment
    ---------------------
    * A new Sprint map: "|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||" by st (otherwise
    known as
      linesprint).
    * Branches now have exactly one exit stair (except the Dungeon, which
    can,
      but is not guaranteed, to have more).
    * Many new layouts have been added to most branches, including unique
    layouts
      for branches that didn't have them; and numerous tweaks and
      improvements
      to existing layouts.
    * Vaults can now be placed at the centre of some layouts prepared to
    accept
      them there.
    * All portal vaults entrances that time out are now announced.
    * Temple overflow altars can now contain multiple altars.
    * New shop type: gadget shops, which sell evokable items.
    * Mechanical traps do not spawn outside of vaults.
    * Zot trap effects are now only a subset of the full set of miscasts, and
      have some new unique effects - draining of wand charges and Word of
      Recall
      (as per ironbrand convokers).

    Character
    ---------
    * A new race: Gargoyles, with low natural HP but an impressive host of
      resistances and the ability to fly at XL14.
    * Sludge elves are no more.
    * The Skald background gets a reworked spellbook with four new spells:
        - Infusion grants additional melee damage costing MP with each
        strike;
        - Song of Slaying grants an incremental slaying bonus with every
        monster
          killed (of sufficient threat level);
        - Spectral Weapon creates an allied spectral clone of your weapon
          which strikes enemies in melee when you do.
        - Song of Shielding has a similar effect to Spirit Shield, trading HP
          loss for MP loss.
    * Priests are no more.
    * The nausea status from eating contaminated chunks has been removed;
      contaminated chunks now give less nutrition for characters that can't
      handle them.
    * Stabbing skill is no more; stabs now depend upon the average of the
      character's stealth and weapon skill.
    * The Traps skill is no more; all characters detect traps as though they
      had (XL/3) Traps skill.
    * Chaos knights start with a +0 chaos weapon instead of a +2 normal
    weapon.
    * New tier 2 demonspawn mutation - "magic shield", giving spirit shield
      at level one, improved magic regeneration at level two, and
      regenerating
      mana in place of health as a function of current magic level at level
      three.
    * Deaths to acid, self-targetting, and sticky flame now credit
      the appropriate monster/spell.
    * Draining a stat to zero can no longer directly kill the player;
    instead,
      further stat drain damages the player. The effects of a stat being at
      zero
      (fainting, slow actions, etc.) persist.
    * Ogre hunters and artificers now start with a club instead of a short
    sword.

    Monsters
    --------
    * New/reworked Crypt monsters:
        - Wraiths, shadow wraiths, and eidolons drain speed instead of XP.
        - Eidolons deal more melee damage and can cast bolt of draining.
        - Phantasmal warriors can temporarily reduce their target's magic
          resistance and can blink closer to their foes.
        - Flayed ghosts gain a smite-targetted flaying attack, dealing
          temporary damage that scales with XP and goes away when the flayed
          ghost is killed and/or enough time passes.
        - Ancient champions, formerly a vault-specific monster, are now
          full randomly-generated monsters, coming with a band of skeletal
          warriors 50% of the time.
        - Vampire mages cast vampiric draining more often, and have slightly
          higher HD and HP; they also come with a band of vampires.
        - Rotting hulks are now plague shamblers, capable of inflicting a
          "retching" status effect that prevents food consumption; they
          generate a cloud of miasma on death.
        - Spectral things move at their full base monster speed.
        - Deep dwarf death knights gain slightly better attack power and
          starting equipment, and now come with a band of undead.
        - Flying skulls get a slight HP boost and a larger attack power
        boost.
        - Ghouls inflict rot half as often.
        - Curse skulls are capable of out-of-LOS movement, similar to
        wandering
          mushrooms, but preferring to place themselves where a player needs
          to
          move the most to actually reach them.
        - New monster: revenants, possessing a ghostly fireball attack and
          capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm
          undead and occasionally summon spectral things.
        - New monster: lost souls, who sacrifice themselves to heal nearby
          undead creatures or assume the shape of a nearby killed living
          creature; they can be summoned by deep elf death mages.
        - Necromancers don't come with necrophages, but do some with
        simulacra.
        - Unborn deep dwarves are now just unborn.
        - New monster: jiangshi, who move in short bursts (like sixfirhies)
        and
          possess a vampiric melee attack.
    * New forest-themed monsters:
        - Spriggan assassins and enchanters, who attempt to disable the
        player
          with blowguns and hexes respectively before moving in for the kill.
        - Wind drakes, who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and airstrike
        the
          player.
    * Other new monsters:
        - Tengu reavers, skilled with both steel and spells; appearing in the
          late dungeon and in Vaults.
        - Deathcaps, summonable by curse toes - tougher wandering mushrooms
          with Drain Life.
    * New unique: Sojobo, king of the tengu.
    * Jory now spawns normally in the late dungeon, instead of being limited
    to
      vaults.
    * Adjustments to some tier 4 demons:
        - Orange demons' sting has a 50% chance of inflicting a Weakness
        status,
          which reduces the player's attack damage.
        - Blue devils have a swooping attack, where they can immediately move
          adjacent to the player and attack from up to four tiles away.
        - Red devils can now hop backwards from adjacent foes to make use of
        their
          now-guaranteed polearms' reaching attacks.
    * Adjustments to the elementals:
        - Water elementals have an asphyxiation attack which lasts as long as
          their target is next to them, and have slightly increased AC and
          HP.
        - Fire elementals (and fire vortices) deal pure fire damage.
    * Updated spell set for several monsters:
        - Draconian shifters:
            - Banishment is dropped.
            - A new monster spell: Dimension Anchor, which temporarily
            prevents
              teleportation, blinking, and Phase Shift.
            - A new monster spell: Blink Allies Encircling, which blinks
            nearby
              allies around the target.
            - Controlled Blink is replaced with Blink Away as an emergency
            spell.
        - Spriggan air mages:
            - Drop Swiftness.
            - New spell: Control Winds, which manipulates clouds (including
              putting out fores fires immediately), and improves allied
              ranged weapon accuracy.
        - Spriggan druids:
            - Drop Summon Caniforms.
            - New spells: Haste Plants, which hastes nearby plant-like
            enemies,
              and Druid's Call, which calls wildlife from elsewhere on the
              level
              to aid the druid.
        - The Enchantress:
            - Banishment is banished.
            - Gains Dimension Anchor (see draconian shifter entry above),
            Strip
              Resistance (lowers the magic resistance of the target), and
              Mass
              Confusion.
        - Curse toes:
            - No more Summon Undead.
        - Deep elf summoners:
            - Summon Demon replaced with Summon Vermin, which summons orange
              rats, spiders, and some other things.
        - Deep elf priests/high priests:
            - A new spell "Malign Offering", which steals HP from the target
              to give to their allies.
        - Deep elf mages:
            - Entirely new spellsets:
                - Freeze, Throw Icicle, Summon Ice Beast;
                - Bolt of Magma, Stone Arrow, Petrify;
                - Iskenderun's Mystic Blast, Slow, Venom Bolt, Blink;
                - Flame Tongue, Throw Flame, Sticky Flame, Fireball;
                - Magic Dart, Force Lance, Iskenderun's Mystic Blast,
                  Iskenderun's Battlesphere.
        - Deep elf conjurers:
            - Only one spellset (bolt of fire, bolt of cold, lightning bolt,
              bolt of draining); the spell set with sticky flame has been
              removed.
        - Gloorx Vloq:
            - No longer has Invisibility as an emergency spell.
    * Speed adjustments to several monsters:
        - Speed 8: spiny worms, snapping turtles, guardian mummies (all
        previously
          speed 9).
        - Speed 10: jellies (previously 9).
    * Shadows can now turn invisible, allowing them to move faster and
      land a guaranteed stab attack on enemies.
    * The retribution effect for killing an apis now inflicts Weakness on
      the player, instead of healing nearby hostiles.
    * Giant fireflies can now signal nearby awake monsters in a manner
    similar to
      shouting.
    * Vault wardens can seal stairways in addition to doors.
    * Zombies no longer appear excessively out of depth in the early dungeon.
    * Orb run monster spawns no longer include weak monsters, and now include
      Orb Guardians.
    * Monster actions are now taken in order of speed, rather than any given
      monster taking all of its actions at once.
    * Removed monsters:
        - Laboratory rats.
        - War dogs (replaced by wolves with essentially matching stats).
        - Deep dwarf scions, necromancers, and artificers.
        - Deep elf soldiers.
        - A large number of vault-specific monsters.
    * Imps and other weak monsters no longer appear in Pan.
    * Nergalle appears earlier in the dungeon.
    * Lamia no longer comes with a band of minions.
    * Creatures other than natural creatures can now be frenzied; this causes
      them to attack anything in sight. The berserking effect of frenzy
      (might
      and haste effects) is limited to natural creatures.

    Spells
    ------
    * New spells:
      - Searing Ray, a level 2 conjuration replacing Force Lance in the
        Book of Conjurations that deals damage over several consecutive
        turns.
      - Discord, a level 8 hex that attempts to frenzy all monsters in sight.
    * Summon Small Mammals now only ever summons one mammal, and is renamed
    to
      Summon Small Mammal as a consequence.
    * 100% of teleports on the orb run are delays (up from 50%).
    * Haunt adjustments:
        - Summons now fixate on their target.
        - Flayed ghosts are no longer summoned.
        - Friendlies are no longer targettable.
    * Olgreb's Toxic Radiance now poisons continuously over several turns
    (and
      deals impact damage); it also ignores the caster's poison resistance
      (if
      any).
    * Dragon Form is pure Transmutations (was Tmut/Fire for all but
    Draconians).
    * Force Lance is now level 5 (was level 2), with boosted range and damage
      to match.
    * Fulminant Prism now caps at 200 spellpower.
    * Swiftness can be cast in water; it doesn't operate in water, but it
      grants the status (which operates as expected when out of the water).
    * Summons caps are introduced. This acts on a per-spell basis, each spell
      has a fixed numerical limit for the number of summons active at any
      time.
      Going over this limit means your oldest summons will expire in a very
      short number of turns. Applies only to non-necromantic non-permanent
      summons.
    * Temporary summons will no longer follow the player down stairs.
    * Temporary summons expire when the player moves to a different level.

    Items
    -----
    * The elemental evocation items have been reworked:
        - All no longer depend on elemental magic skill or nearby terrain,
        can
          summon multiple elementals, and have an XP-based recharge timer.
        - The lamp of fire fires up to three trails of flame in a given
        direction.
        - The fan of air elementals is now the fan of gales, and blows back
          nearby enemies.
        - The stone of earth elementals is now the stone of tremors; it
        causes
          rubble to fall from nearby rock, stone, or permarock walls to
          damage
          creatures adjacent to them, and has a chance to shaft creatures;
        - A new elemental evoker item - the phial of floods; it generates a
        wave
          of water which temporarily leaves a pool of water behind, and
          summons
          water elementals.
    * The dependence of armour penalties on strength has been adjusted; there
      are no longer magic strength numbers for lowest possible penalties.
    * Potions of gain <ability> have been replaced by potions of beneficial
      mutation, which grant the player a single beneficial mutation.
    * Scrolls of vorpalise weapons are now scrolls of brand weapon, and can
      rebrand weapons that already have a permanent brand affixed.
    * Scrolls of immolation have been reworked to inner flame everything in
      LOS.
    * Lear's chain mail is now Lear's hauberk - a +27 chain mail that covers
      all armour slots other than shields and cloaks.
    * The staves of energy eliminates 100% of spell hunger again, and
    includes
      the now-gone staff of channeling as well.
    * The staff of power scales with your maximum magic power.
    * Box of beasts has been reworked:
        - Has a fixed, random number of charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
        - 1/3 chance to fail on usage with no bad effects.
        - When successful, generates a chimera; a new monster with three
        heads.
          Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which
          provides
          better/stronger beasts at higher Evocations skill. The heads
          determine
          the attacks and abilities available to the monster.
    * New "sack of spiders" item:
        - Fixed charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
        - On evoking, creates webs around you and releases spiders.
        - Number of webs and type/number of spiders scales with evocations.
    * Splint mail has been removed; chain mail is now 8 AC to compensate.
    * Needles of sickness have been removed.
    * Manuals do not need to be read to be activated; they're always on while
    in
      inventory.
    * The rod of striking now functions as a melee weapon - it expends
    charges
      to deal additional damage in melee.
    * Boots of running have a -1 movement delay (was -2).
    * The lantern of shadows' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations,
      and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.
    * New unrand: the +4 moon troll leather armour {Spirit MP+5 Regen}.
    * Adjustments to unrands:
       - Arga is now a broad axe.
       - The shield of the gong no longer has guardian spirit; it is
       otherwise
         unchanged.
       - The knife of accuracy and boots of the Assassin are no more.
       - The lightning scales are now +6 (was +3).
    * Hammers do not generate outside of vaults.

    Gods
    ----
    * Yredelemnul no longer gifts rotting hulks / plague shamblers.
    * Orcs encountering an orc priest for the first time are offered the
    chance
      to convert to Beogh on the spot.
    * Recite no longer paralyses the player; the player can take any action
      that doesn't involve the mouth while reciting.

    Interface
    ---------
    * For online play, explore_delay and travel_delay are instananeous by
    default.
    * Dungeon features with variable-colour tiles now display those colours
    in
      tiles (e.g. walls in the Abyss, the Elven Halls, and the Pan disco
      hall).
    * Examining a monster will display the spells monsters of its type are
      capable of using.

    Technical
    ---------
    * A port to OpenSolaris (Dyson/Illumos).
    * MSVC compilation once again possible (Visual Studio [Express] 2012)

    * The Vaults branch is five levels deep, with a distinct layout and

    Branches, environment
    ---------------------
    * The Hall of Blades layout has been adjusted, and now contains two
    weapons
      with "interesting brands" instead of just one.
    * The Abyss is revamped yet again. It now contains five (still infinite)
      levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with
      different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The rune
      appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper
      levels.
    * The Abyssal rune always appears in a vault, never lying around on the
    floor.
    * Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss
    exits.
    * Many Ziggurat floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few
    monster
      sets have been replaced entirely.
    * Three new Sprint maps: "Thunderdome" by evilmike, "The Pits" and "Arena
    of
      Blood" both by st.
    * The Abyss no longer exists in Sprint.
    * New layouts for Cocytus, Gehenna, Snake, and the main Dungeon.
    * More layouts allowed in Zot.
    * New Lair branch ending vaults, and many other new vaults.
    * More decorative vaults are now placed.
    * "Special rooms" (kobold/orc rooms, beehives, morgues, jelly pits) have
    been
      adjusted, now appear at more appropriate depths and layouts, and no
      longer
      place doors.
    * A new "special room" - the mythical zoo, with standard high fantasy
    beasts.
    * New "runed door" feature: won't be opened by auto-explore or by
    monsters.
      Becomes a regular door when opened.
    * Alarm traps only trigger once, but make monsters swarm towards you for
    some
      time.

    Character
    ---------
    * Stalker is removed.
    * Berserkers may choose their starting weapon.
    * Gladiator no longer starts with a buckler, gets more Dodging to
    compensate.
    * Traps are spotted (or not) deterministically based on skill level and a
      few other factors: spending more time does not help.
    * Levitation and controlled flight are no more - all flight is
    controlled.

    and
      Invocations. Aptitudes adjusted.
    * Experience aptitude uses the same scale as skill aptitudes. This scale
    is
      coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or
      less
      experience to gain levels than before.
    * Deep Elves are better at Earth magic than Air.
    * Hill Orcs are better at Axes, worse at gaining levels.

        - Tentacled starspawn: has constricting tentacles and a nasty attack.
        - Ancient zyme: causes sickness when near the player.
        - Lurking horror: stalks like a wandering mushroom, then explodes for
          torment.
        - Starcursed mass: proliferates when ignored, re-merges when damaged.
          Has a smite-targeted psychic scream that becomes more powerful as
          more masses become visible.
        - Apocalypse crab: breathes clouds of chaos.

          accompanying deep troll packs.
        - Deep troll earth mages: cast Dig and LRD to allow the rest of the
        deep
          troll pack to pursue their opponent.
    * New vaults monsters:

          to
          the player's location.

        player

        of
          an enemy the player is currently attacking.
    * New uniques:
        - Jorgrun, a deep dwarven earth elementalist.
        - Lamia, queen of the nagas.
    * Friendly summoned monsters do not attack things unless the player has
    line
      of sight to both the summon and the victim. Glass does not count as
      line of
      sight for this purpose.
    * Summoned monsters do not cast spells that create permanent allies.
    * Only a select few monsters flee at low HP.
    * Ereshkigal has more HP, and can now cast Silence and Major Healing.

        single-target
          projectile that can knock monsters backwards.
        - Dazzling Spray (level 3 Conjuration/Hexes). Fires a spread of
        energy
          bolts that can blind creatures.
        - Iskenderun's Battlesphere (level 4 Conjuration/Charms). Creates an
          autonomous globe that shoots at enemies in sync with your
          conjurations.
        - Fulminant Prism (level 5 Conjuration/Hexes). Creates a time bomb at
        a
          smite-targetted location.
        - Disjunction (level 8 Translocation). Has a duration, during which
        it
          blinks away nearby monsters. Causes contamination.
    * Conjurers have a new book with non-elemental spells (including the new
      conjurations).
    * Spell memorisation failure is no more. As long as the failure chance is
      not 100%, the spell can be memorized. There is a warning prompt if the
      chance of a miscast is high.

    often.
    * Recall is now gradual instead of instant: one ally is recalled every

    Items
    -----
    * Axes have a cleaving attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single
      swing (all directions except directly opposite the direction of attack,
      but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75%
      damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is
      reduced
      to compensate.
    * One-handed maces and flails have been improved: flails and eveningstars
    get
      a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1
      damage/accuracy
      boost to replace spiked flails.
    * The wand of polymorph other is now the wand of polymorph; use of it
    against
      the player will turn them into a random form (including several new
      forms -
      tree form, wisp form, porcupine form and fungus form).
    * Scroll of unholy creation is replaced with scroll of summoning, which
      summons a few level-appropriate monsters.
    * Removed items: spiked flail, potion of water, staff of enchantment,
    plain
      (non-magic, non-quarter-) staves
    * Potion of decay rots HP immediately rather than giving the "Rot"
    status.
    * Potions and rings of levitation are now "of flight"; boots of
    levitation
      are now "of flying"; and the +Lev artefact property is now +Fly.
    * Amulet of controlled flight is removed; Amulet of the Air now grants
      passive Repel Missiles and inaccuracy instead.
    * Amulet of inaccuracy correctly affects ranged weapons.
    * Amulet of clarity prevents mesmerisation.
    * Some rods were changed to have a more focused spell set.
    * The "Contam" artefact property no longer causes contamination over
    time,
      but only when the item is unequipped.
    * The "*Rage" artefact property triggers much less often (except for
    Wrath of
      Trog).
    * Improved fixedarts: Spear of the Botono, Robe of Night, Cloak of the
    Thief,
      Robe of Folly, plutonium sword.
    * The hand-and-a-half weapon category is gone; such weapons are now
      one-handed for normal-size races.

    across
      levels.
    * Followers of Beoghites now share experience when the player scores
    kills.

      skills.

      cost.
    * Zin's Imprisonment placement is much more forgiving, pushing adjacent
      monsters out of the way if possible.
    * Lugonu's Enter the Abyss no longer reduces maximum HP or MP.
    * Lugonu no longer gives piety for anything in the Abyss.
    * Mobile Fedhas-granted allies follow you across levels en masse.
    * New Xom effects: loud noises, blink monsters, enchant monster (petrify,
      slow, paralysis, enslavement; haste, might, invisibility), summon
      shadow
      creatures.
    * Xom does not reduce stats as drastically, unless bored.
    * Xom will not animate or swap weapons in the Abyss, and will not
    hostilely
      animate your weapon at all anymore.

      but will ignore plants.

    by
      prefixing it with "@".
