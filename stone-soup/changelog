    ---------------------

    * Some areas of the Tomb layout can now vary.

    * Mutagenic fog now causes large amounts of glow instead of mutating
    directly.

    Character
    ---------
    * Inventory item weight and player burden states are no more.
    * Cross-training now gives a direct bonus to cross-trained skills, rather
    than decreasing the XP cost of learning them.
    * Anti-training (for opposite elemental schools) has been removed.
    * Formicids can no longer throw large rocks.
    * Tengu now gain permaflight at XL14 (was 15).

    * Kobolds no longer have disease resistance.
    * Halflings have rebalanced stats and aptitudes, shifting them towards
    defense.

    longer have a slow metabolism.
    * Centaurs are no longer herbivorous.
    * Vampires:
      - always get the full effect of all potions;
      - can always mutate; and
      - always get the full effect of all mutations.
    * Some Demonspawn mutations have been modified:
      - The Foul Stench facet gives rot immunity earlier and separately
      instead of saprovore.
      - Facets which gave potion/scroll item conservation now give
      freezing/fire cloud immunity earlier and separately.

      players wearing boots.

    stings (wasps) can now slow through rPois.

    Monsters
    --------
    * Many enemy glyphs have been adjusted. See 0.14_monster_glyphs.txt.
    * Monsters will no longer pick up items that the player has seen. Allies
    won't pick up items at all.
    * Corrosion affects all of your equipment, but only temporarily, and the
    chance to corrode equipment does not consider item enchantment.
    * Draining effects no longer permanently reduce monsters' stats ('hit
    dice'); instead, they apply a temporary status which reduces hit dice
    for the duration.
    * Monsters no longer fall asleep after long periods of time.
    * New monster: ghost crabs, found in Crypt. They breathe ghostly flames
    that call dangerous specters into existence.
    * New monster: torpor snails, found in Lair and Spider. Their enemies are
      slowed on sight, somewhat like ancient zymes.
    * Enemies are more intelligent about using area-of-attack spells such as

    * Komodo dragons now bite harder but don't sicken the player.
    * Purple ugly things deal extra damage in lieu of a sickness attack.

    * Undead and nonliving enemies regenerate as fast as other enemies.
    * Silver statues and orange crystal statues are immune to disintegration,
      but have less health and AC and have their abilities converted to
      spells such that they spam less; this implies OCS confusion can be
      resisted.
    * Bog bodies no longer randomly rot.
    * Undead monsters will now fall to pieces in deep water, instead of
    hiding invisibly.
    * Curse skulls are now immobile, again.

      flaming corpses, grizzly bears, spriggan enchanters, phoenixes, shedu,
      plague shamblers, giant slugs, elephant slugs, giant fireflies, brown
      oozes, pulsating lumps, big fish, sharks, lava worms.

    Spells
    ------
    * Dazzling Spray replaces Invisibility in the book of Maledictions (the
      Enchanter starting spellbook). Invisibility in turn replaces
      Apportation in the book of Burglary.
    * Casting Ozocubu's Refrigeration now prevents the player from using
    potions for several turns instead of destroying potions.
    * Spider Form now moves at normal speed, and no longer gives clinging.
    * Tukima's Dance now animates weapons held by monsters. The weapons will
    fight against their former owners. It is also now level 3.
    * Confusing Touch now has a short, non-stacking duration which discharges
      entirely when it successfully confuses an enemy. While it's in effect,
      your attacks do no damage. It's been moved to level 2.
    * Sublimation of Blood no longer uses chunks; it now only draws from the
      caster's HP. Fedhas now permits its use.
    * Simulacrum now works on a single corpse at the caster's feet, creating
      several simulacra from it.
    * Monsters casting Simulacrum now affect all corpses in LOS, producing
    half as many simulacra as the player version of the spell.
    * Many spells, which used player skill, now use spellpower instead:
    Death's Door, Passwall, Sticks to Snakes, Ozocubu's Armour, Condensation
      Shield, Stoneskin, Statue Form, and Ice Form.

    * Removed spells: Fire Brand, Freezing Aura, Lethal Infusion, Poison
    Weapon, Summon Elemental.

    Items
    -----
    * Item destruction is no more.
    * Ranged combat has been rewritten based on melee attacks - AC and EV
      has more of an impact, attack delay is more predictable, and Throwing
      should be more viable as a ranged option as compared to bows and
      crossbows, among other changes.
      - Slings have been split into two weapon types; the basic type has been
        renamed to 'hunting sling', and a new, rare 'greatsling' has been
        added.
      - Crossbows have been split into three types. The hand crossbow returns
      as a starting weapon; the basic crossbow has been renamed to an
        'arbalest'; and a new, rare 'triple crossbow' type has been added.
      - (Plain) bows have been renamed to shortbows.
    * Weapon enchantment & slaying bonsues have been merged into a single
      number, giving both +accuracy & +damage. Scrolls of enchant weapon I,
      II, and III have all been merged into a new "enchant weapon" scroll.
      The scrolls are rarer, but always succeed.
    * Shields have been rebalanced. All non-shield-enchantment sources of SH
      have been halved, and the effectiveness of SH at blocking attacks has
      been doubled, to make the utility of a point of SH roughly equivalent
      to a point of EV. In effect, this is a small buff. Non-bucklers can
      now be enchanted past +3.
    * Multiple changes to unrandarts:
      - The blowgun of the Assassin returns; it has a chance to affect the
      target more than normal blowguns.
      - New unrand: the +8 orange crystal plate armour {Archmagi, Int+3 Clar
        SustAb}.
      - New unrand: the +6 Majin-Bo {vamp, Archmagi, MP+6 Int+6}. A
      quarterstaff that takes HP every time you cast a spell.
      - The dagger of Chilly Death now sometimes flash-freezes enemies,
      slowing their movement, and the scimitar of Flaming Death now sometimes
        applies sticky flame to its victims.
      - Leech is now +8, with -2 to all stats (instead of -1), and -2 to both
      AC and EV.
      - Skullcrusher is now +3 with +7 strength.
      - The Trident of the Octopus King now starts at +8 and gets an
      additional +
        for each Ring of the Octopus King worn. If anyone reads this & gets
        it to +10 or higher in an actual game, send screenshots!
      - Punk is now a +7 greatsling {Freeze, rC+}.
      - Sniper is now a "heavy crossbow", a triple crossbow with 27 base
      delay.
      - The Mace of Brilliance is now the +1 Eveningstar "Brilliance".
      - Many other weapon artefacts have had their enchantments tweaked.
      - Maxwell's Patent Armour now gives rF+ rC+ instead of Conservation.
      - The Shield of Resistance, Shield of the Gong, and Large Shield of
      Ignorance
        have had their enchantment levels adjusted.
      - Removed unrands: the boots of the Spider.
    * Branding changes:
      - Scrolls of brand weapon will no longer make temporary brands
      permanent, but can now randomly apply any brand to an unbranded
      weapon.
      - Blessed weapons can be rebranded.
      - Rebranding a distortion weapon no longer causes a distortion effect.
      - Branded non-artefact weapons can now be given a temporary re-brand.
      - Damage from the electrocution brand has been reduced slightly.
      - Draining now triggers somewhat less often, but will cause monsters to
      be temporarily drained whenever it does fire.
      - The dragonslaying brand is no longer generated. (Wyrmbane still has
      it.)
    * Food changes:
      - Honeycombs have been renamed to royal jellies; they don't restore
        abilities.
      - Potions of blood cure a point of ghoul rotting.
      - All types of fruit have been merged together into one gooey, messy
      item type.
      - Brown (contaminated) chunks are gone, replaced with normal ones.
      - Cheese, sausages, and ambrosia are no more.
    * New item: potion of cancellation, which removes enchantments &
    contamination on the player.
    * Scrolls of vulnerability have been simplified; they now just halve MR
    for all creatures in LOS.
    * Cancellation-type effects (from the potion, quicksilver dragons, etc)
    now
      reduce transformation durations to one turn, rather than cancelling
      them immediately.
    * Identify scrolls now always identify a single item.
    * Jewellery automatically identifies once equipped.
    * Amulets of inaccuracy are always cursed.
    * New rings of stealth and loudness, which positively/negatively adjust
      a player's stealth.
    * Amulets of rage no longer have a tiny chance of extending berserk
    duration.
    * Sacks of spiders now place webs directly onto enemies, rather than
    spreading them randomly around the area.
    * Cleaving hits the full eight squares around a player, when not blocked
    by walls.
    * Putting on or taking off armour now always takes five turns.
    * Gloves of archery no longer penalise melee.

    * Amulets of resist corrosion now give only 50% corrosion resistance,
    from 90%.
    * Potions of resistance now grant corrosion resistance.
    * Staves of air now activate extra melee damage as often as other
    elemental staves.
    * Flying creatures no longer have a 2/3rds chance of dodging thrown nets.
    * Weapons and armour which aren't visibly enchanted no longer have
    enchantments higher than +0.
    * Corpses and skeletons are stationary, and can't be picked up nor
    apported.
    * Other removed items: darts, rings of hunger and sustenance, amulet of
      conservation, cloak of preservation, potions of strong poison and
      paralysis.

    Cards
    -----
    * New cards.
      - Fortitude, which gives Damage Shaving and a bonus to strength.
      - Storm, which can make shallow water, a tornado, or cause swiftness.
      - Cloud, which spawns dangerous clouds around the user and on hostiles.
      - Degeneration, which polymorphs nearby monsters into weaker ones.

      of the Flight card.

    * Revamped cards.

    ----
    * New god: Qazlal Stormbringer. Qazlal is a temple god, with an altar
    either in
      Temple or on D:2-9.
      - Piety on kills.
      - All followers are immune from their own clouds.
      - 1*: Storm Shield: you passively generate elemental clouds around you
      and gain bonus SH, and gain RMsl at 3*; you also generate a lot of
            noise.
      - 2*: Upheaval: blast a small nearby area with elemental forces.
      - 3*: Elemental Force: turn nearby clouds into elementals.
      - 4*: Elemental Adaptation: taking elemental or physical damage
      sometimes temporarily grants you resistance against that element.
      - 5*: Disaster Area: blast the entire area around you with elemental
            forces.
    * Nemelex has been revamped.
      - Nemelex only gives piety for exploration rather than item sacrifices
      or deck usage.

      with other Nemelex abilities.

      section for details.

    armour, and ammo to orcs who lack them.

    neutral.

    monsters in sight with the strongest effects that would impact them.
    * Ashenzari now counts Felids as fully bound when all of their jewellery
    slots are cursed.
    * Sif Muna wrath can no longer cause amnesia.

    appearing.

    can,
      but is not guaranteed, to have more).
    * Many new layouts have been added to most branches, including unique
    layouts
      for branches that didn't have them; and numerous tweaks and

        monster
          killed (of sufficient threat level);

    * Deaths to acid, self-targetting, and sticky flame now credit
      the appropriate monster/spell.
    * Draining a stat to zero can no longer directly kill the player;
    instead,
      further stat drain damages the player. The effects of a stat being at
      zero
      (fainting, slow actions, etc.) persist.
    * Ogre hunters and artificers now start with a club instead of a short
    sword.

    Monsters
    --------
    * New/reworked Crypt monsters:
        - Wraiths, shadow wraiths, and eidolons drain speed instead of XP.
        - Eidolons deal more melee damage and can cast bolt of draining.
        - Phantasmal warriors can temporarily reduce their target's magic
          resistance and can blink closer to their foes.
        - Flayed ghosts gain a smite-targetted flaying attack, dealing
          temporary damage that scales with XP and goes away when the flayed
          ghost is killed and/or enough time passes.
        - Ancient champions, formerly a vault-specific monster, are now
          full randomly-generated monsters, coming with a band of skeletal
          warriors 50% of the time.
        - Vampire mages cast vampiric draining more often, and have slightly
          higher HD and HP; they also come with a band of vampires.
        - Rotting hulks are now plague shamblers, capable of inflicting a
          "retching" status effect that prevents food consumption; they
          generate a cloud of miasma on death.
        - Spectral things move at their full base monster speed.
        - Deep dwarf death knights gain slightly better attack power and
          starting equipment, and now come with a band of undead.
        - Flying skulls get a slight HP boost and a larger attack power
        boost.
        - Ghouls inflict rot half as often.
        - Curse skulls are capable of out-of-LOS movement, similar to
        wandering
          mushrooms, but preferring to place themselves where a player needs
          to
          move the most to actually reach them.
        - New monster: revenants, possessing a ghostly fireball attack and
          capable of creating clouds of ghostly flame, which do not harm
          undead and occasionally summon spectral things.
        - New monster: lost souls, who sacrifice themselves to heal nearby
          undead creatures or assume the shape of a nearby killed living
          creature; they can be summoned by deep elf death mages.
        - Necromancers don't come with necrophages, but do some with
        simulacra.
        - Unborn deep dwarves are now just unborn.
        - New monster: jiangshi, who move in short bursts (like sixfirhies)
        and
          possess a vampiric melee attack.
    * New forest-themed monsters:
        - Spriggan assassins and enchanters, who attempt to disable the
        player
          with blowguns and hexes respectively before moving in for the kill.
        - Wind drakes, who can breathe powerful blasts of wind and airstrike
        the
          player.
    * Other new monsters:
        - Tengu reavers, skilled with both steel and spells; appearing in the
          late dungeon and in Vaults.
        - Deathcaps, summonable by curse toes - tougher wandering mushrooms
          with Drain Life.
    * New unique: Sojobo, king of the tengu.
    * Jory now spawns normally in the late dungeon, instead of being limited
    to
      vaults.
    * Adjustments to some tier 4 demons:
        - Orange demons' sting has a 50% chance of inflicting a Weakness
        status,
          which reduces the player's attack damage.
        - Blue devils have a swooping attack, where they can immediately move
          adjacent to the player and attack from up to four tiles away.
        - Red devils can now hop backwards from adjacent foes to make use of
        their
          now-guaranteed polearms' reaching attacks.
    * Adjustments to the elementals:
        - Water elementals have an asphyxiation attack which lasts as long as
          their target is next to them, and have slightly increased AC and
          HP.
        - Fire elementals (and fire vortices) deal pure fire damage.
    * Updated spell set for several monsters:
        - Draconian shifters:
            - Banishment is dropped.
            - A new monster spell: Dimension Anchor, which temporarily
            prevents
              teleportation, blinking, and Phase Shift.
            - A new monster spell: Blink Allies Encircling, which blinks
            nearby
              allies around the target.
            - Controlled Blink is replaced with Blink Away as an emergency
            spell.
        - Spriggan air mages:
            - Drop Swiftness.
            - New spell: Control Winds, which manipulates clouds (including
              putting out fores fires immediately), and improves allied
              ranged weapon accuracy.
        - Spriggan druids:
            - Drop Summon Caniforms.
            - New spells: Haste Plants, which hastes nearby plant-like
            enemies,
              and Druid's Call, which calls wildlife from elsewhere on the
              level
              to aid the druid.
        - The Enchantress:
            - Banishment is banished.
            - Gains Dimension Anchor (see draconian shifter entry above),
            Strip
              Resistance (lowers the magic resistance of the target), and
              Mass
              Confusion.
        - Curse toes:
            - No more Summon Undead.
        - Deep elf summoners:
            - Summon Demon replaced with Summon Vermin, which summons orange
              rats, spiders, and some other things.
        - Deep elf priests/high priests:
            - A new spell "Malign Offering", which steals HP from the target
              to give to their allies.
        - Deep elf mages:
            - Entirely new spellsets:
                - Freeze, Throw Icicle, Summon Ice Beast;
                - Bolt of Magma, Stone Arrow, Petrify;
                - Iskenderun's Mystic Blast, Slow, Venom Bolt, Blink;
                - Flame Tongue, Throw Flame, Sticky Flame, Fireball;
                - Magic Dart, Force Lance, Iskenderun's Mystic Blast,
                  Iskenderun's Battlesphere.
        - Deep elf conjurers:
            - Only one spellset (bolt of fire, bolt of cold, lightning bolt,
              bolt of draining); the spell set with sticky flame has been
              removed.
        - Gloorx Vloq:
            - No longer has Invisibility as an emergency spell.
    * Speed adjustments to several monsters:
        - Speed 8: spiny worms, snapping turtles, guardian mummies (all
        previously
          speed 9).
        - Speed 10: jellies (previously 9).
    * Shadows can now turn invisible, allowing them to move faster and
      land a guaranteed stab attack on enemies.
    * The retribution effect for killing an apis now inflicts Weakness on
      the player, instead of healing nearby hostiles.
    * Giant fireflies can now signal nearby awake monsters in a manner
    similar to
      shouting.
    * Vault wardens can seal stairways in addition to doors.
    * Zombies no longer appear excessively out of depth in the early dungeon.
    * Orb run monster spawns no longer include weak monsters, and now include
      Orb Guardians.
    * Monster actions are now taken in order of speed, rather than any given
      monster taking all of its actions at once.
    * Removed monsters:
        - Laboratory rats.
        - War dogs (replaced by wolves with essentially matching stats).
        - Deep dwarf scions, necromancers, and artificers.
        - Deep elf soldiers.
        - A large number of vault-specific monsters.
    * Imps and other weak monsters no longer appear in Pan.
    * Nergalle appears earlier in the dungeon.
    * Lamia no longer comes with a band of minions.
    * Creatures other than natural creatures can now be frenzied; this causes
      them to attack anything in sight. The berserking effect of frenzy
      (might
      and haste effects) is limited to natural creatures.

    Spells
    ------
    * New spells:
      - Searing Ray, a level 2 conjuration replacing Force Lance in the
        Book of Conjurations that deals damage over several consecutive
        turns.
      - Discord, a level 8 hex that attempts to frenzy all monsters in sight.
    * Summon Small Mammals now only ever summons one mammal, and is renamed
    to
      Summon Small Mammal as a consequence.
    * 100% of teleports on the orb run are delays (up from 50%).
    * Haunt adjustments:
        - Summons now fixate on their target.
        - Flayed ghosts are no longer summoned.
        - Friendlies are no longer targettable.
    * Olgreb's Toxic Radiance now poisons continuously over several turns
    (and
      deals impact damage); it also ignores the caster's poison resistance
      (if
      any).
    * Dragon Form is pure Transmutations (was Tmut/Fire for all but
    Draconians).
    * Force Lance is now level 5 (was level 2), with boosted range and damage
      to match.
    * Fulminant Prism now caps at 200 spellpower.
    * Swiftness can be cast in water; it doesn't operate in water, but it
      grants the status (which operates as expected when out of the water).
    * Summons caps are introduced. This acts on a per-spell basis, each spell
      has a fixed numerical limit for the number of summons active at any
      time.
      Going over this limit means your oldest summons will expire in a very
      short number of turns. Applies only to non-necromantic non-permanent
      summons.
    * Temporary summons will no longer follow the player down stairs.
    * Temporary summons expire when the player moves to a different level.

    Items
    -----
    * The elemental evocation items have been reworked:
        - All no longer depend on elemental magic skill or nearby terrain,
        can
          summon multiple elementals, and have an XP-based recharge timer.
        - The lamp of fire fires up to three trails of flame in a given
        direction.
        - The fan of air elementals is now the fan of gales, and blows back
          nearby enemies.
        - The stone of earth elementals is now the stone of tremors; it
        causes
          rubble to fall from nearby rock, stone, or permarock walls to
          damage
          creatures adjacent to them, and has a chance to shaft creatures;
        - A new elemental evoker item - the phial of floods; it generates a
        wave
          of water which temporarily leaves a pool of water behind, and
          summons
          water elementals.
    * The dependence of armour penalties on strength has been adjusted; there
      are no longer magic strength numbers for lowest possible penalties.
    * Potions of gain <ability> have been replaced by potions of beneficial
      mutation, which grant the player a single beneficial mutation.
    * Scrolls of vorpalise weapons are now scrolls of brand weapon, and can
      rebrand weapons that already have a permanent brand affixed.
    * Scrolls of immolation have been reworked to inner flame everything in
      LOS.
    * Lear's chain mail is now Lear's hauberk - a +27 chain mail that covers
      all armour slots other than shields and cloaks.
    * The staves of energy eliminates 100% of spell hunger again, and
    includes
      the now-gone staff of channeling as well.
    * The staff of power scales with your maximum magic power.
    * Box of beasts has been reworked:
        - Has a fixed, random number of charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
        - 1/3 chance to fail on usage with no bad effects.
        - When successful, generates a chimera; a new monster with three
        heads.
          Each head can be a different beast, picked from a list which
          provides
          better/stronger beasts at higher Evocations skill. The heads
          determine
          the attacks and abilities available to the monster.
    * New "sack of spiders" item:
        - Fixed charges between 5 and 15 inclusive.
        - On evoking, creates webs around you and releases spiders.
        - Number of webs and type/number of spiders scales with evocations.
    * Splint mail has been removed; chain mail is now 8 AC to compensate.
    * Needles of sickness have been removed.
    * Manuals do not need to be read to be activated; they're always on while
    in
      inventory.
    * The rod of striking now functions as a melee weapon - it expends
    charges
      to deal additional damage in melee.
    * Boots of running have a -1 movement delay (was -2).
    * The lantern of shadows' rate of shadow spawning scales with evocations,
      and the resulting shadows now wander instead of following the player.
    * New unrand: the +4 moon troll leather armour {Spirit MP+5 Regen}.
    * Adjustments to unrands:
       - Arga is now a broad axe.
       - The shield of the gong no longer has guardian spirit; it is
       otherwise
         unchanged.
       - The knife of accuracy and boots of the Assassin are no more.
       - The lightning scales are now +6 (was +3).
    * Hammers do not generate outside of vaults.

    Gods
    ----
    * Yredelemnul no longer gifts rotting hulks / plague shamblers.
    * Orcs encountering an orc priest for the first time are offered the
    chance
      to convert to Beogh on the spot.
    * Recite no longer paralyses the player; the player can take any action
      that doesn't involve the mouth while reciting.

    Interface
    ---------
    * For online play, explore_delay and travel_delay are instananeous by
    default.
    * Dungeon features with variable-colour tiles now display those colours
    in
      tiles (e.g. walls in the Abyss, the Elven Halls, and the Pan disco
      hall).
    * Examining a monster will display the spells monsters of its type are
      capable of using.

    Technical
    ---------
    * A port to OpenSolaris (Dyson/Illumos).
    * MSVC compilation once again possible (Visual Studio [Express] 2012)

    * The Vaults branch is five levels deep, with a distinct layout and

    Branches, environment
    ---------------------
    * The Hall of Blades layout has been adjusted, and now contains two
    weapons
      with "interesting brands" instead of just one.
    * The Abyss is revamped yet again. It now contains five (still infinite)
      levels of increasing difficulty. Each level is composed of regions with
      different layouts, most of which are more static than before. The rune
      appears only at the third level and below, more frequently at deeper
      levels.
    * The Abyssal rune always appears in a vault, never lying around on the
    floor.
    * Having the Abyssal rune greatly increases the generation of Abyss
    exits.
    * Many Ziggurat floors have more fine-tuned monster-sets, and a few
    monster
      sets have been replaced entirely.
    * Three new Sprint maps: "Thunderdome" by evilmike, "The Pits" and "Arena
    of
      Blood" both by st.
    * The Abyss no longer exists in Sprint.
    * New layouts for Cocytus, Gehenna, Snake, and the main Dungeon.
    * More layouts allowed in Zot.
    * New Lair branch ending vaults, and many other new vaults.
    * More decorative vaults are now placed.
    * "Special rooms" (kobold/orc rooms, beehives, morgues, jelly pits) have
    been
      adjusted, now appear at more appropriate depths and layouts, and no
      longer
      place doors.
    * A new "special room" - the mythical zoo, with standard high fantasy
    beasts.
    * New "runed door" feature: won't be opened by auto-explore or by
    monsters.
      Becomes a regular door when opened.
    * Alarm traps only trigger once, but make monsters swarm towards you for
    some
      time.

    Character
    ---------
    * Stalker is removed.
    * Berserkers may choose their starting weapon.
    * Gladiator no longer starts with a buckler, gets more Dodging to
    compensate.
    * Traps are spotted (or not) deterministically based on skill level and a
      few other factors: spending more time does not help.
    * Levitation and controlled flight are no more - all flight is
    controlled.
    * Flying no longer increases carrying capacity.
    * Tengu receive their movement speed bonus when flying, regardless of
    burden.
    * Black draconians gain permanent flight (like Tengu but without the
    speed
      boost) at XL 14.
    * Removed the hidden special cost of Spellcasting, Stealth, Evocations
    and
      Invocations. Aptitudes adjusted.
    * Experience aptitude uses the same scale as skill aptitudes. This scale
    is
      coarser than the old one, so most races now require slightly more or
      less
      experience to gain levels than before.
    * Deep Elves are better at Earth magic than Air.
    * Hill Orcs are better at Axes, worse at gaining levels.
    * Tengu are better at gaining levels.
    * Levels 1 and 2 of the teleportitis mutation teleport you only a limited
      distance.
    * The augmentation and powered by pain Demonspawn mutations have been
    improved.

    Monsters
    --------
    * Removed: ant larvae, bumblebees, blessed toes, rock trolls, wood
    golems.
    * New monster: moth of suppression. Generates an aura that prevents
    evocation
      and suppresses the magical effects of wielded/worn equipment.
    * New abyssal monsters:
        - Wretched star: bestows temporary mutations.
        - Tentacled starspawn: has constricting tentacles and a nasty attack.
        - Ancient zyme: causes sickness when near the player.
        - Lurking horror: stalks like a wandering mushroom, then explodes for
          torment.
        - Starcursed mass: proliferates when ignored, re-merges when damaged.
          Has a smite-targeted psychic scream that becomes more powerful as
          more masses become visible.
        - Apocalypse crab: breathes clouds of chaos.
        - Thrashing horror: moves like a bat, tramples, and frenzies.
        - Spatial maelstrom: incorporeal vortex that turns walls into spatial
          vortices.
    * New deep troll specialist monsters, appearing in late-D deep troll
    packs:
        - Deep troll shamans: cast Might Other and Haste Other on their
          accompanying deep troll packs.
        - Deep troll earth mages: cast Dig and LRD to allow the rest of the
        deep
          troll pack to pursue their opponent.
    * New vaults monsters:
        - Vault sentinels, with a signal horn that generates a lot of noise
        and
          the Sentinel's Mark spell which alerts all creatures on the level
          to
          the player's location.
        - Vault wardens, with the ability to close and seal doors near the
        player
          for a time or until they are killed.
        - Ironbrand convokers, with the ability to recall other monsters on
        the
          level to their location. Also cast Might Other.
        - Ironheart preservers, with the ability to take some damage in place
        of
          an enemy the player is currently attacking.
    * New uniques:
        - Jorgrun, a deep dwarven earth elementalist.
        - Lamia, queen of the nagas.
    * Friendly summoned monsters do not attack things unless the player has
    line
      of sight to both the summon and the victim. Glass does not count as
      line of
      sight for this purpose.
    * Summoned monsters do not cast spells that create permanent allies.
    * Only a select few monsters flee at low HP.
    * Ereshkigal has more HP, and can now cast Silence and Major Healing.
    * Changed monsters: Frances, Joseph, Polyphemus, bone dragons, soul
    eaters,
      vampires, vampire knights.

    Spells
    ------
    * Removed: Fulsome Distillation, Evaporate, Cigotuvi's Degeneration, See
      Invisible and Insulation.
    * New spells:
        - Force Lance (level 2 Conjuration). Fires a short-range
        single-target
          projectile that can knock monsters backwards.
        - Dazzling Spray (level 3 Conjuration/Hexes). Fires a spread of
        energy
          bolts that can blind creatures.
        - Iskenderun's Battlesphere (level 4 Conjuration/Charms). Creates an
          autonomous globe that shoots at enemies in sync with your
          conjurations.
        - Fulminant Prism (level 5 Conjuration/Hexes). Creates a time bomb at
        a
          smite-targetted location.
        - Disjunction (level 8 Translocation). Has a duration, during which
        it
          blinks away nearby monsters. Causes contamination.
    * Conjurers have a new book with non-elemental spells (including the new
      conjurations).
    * Spell memorisation failure is no more. As long as the failure chance is
      not 100%, the spell can be memorized. There is a warning prompt if the
      chance of a miscast is high.
    * Some spellbooks have been reorganized.
    * Condensation Shield's SH bonus no longer cares about Shields skill or
      intelligence.
    * The blinking component of the Dispersal spell is irresistible.

    often.
    * Recall is now gradual instead of instant: one ally is recalled every
    3-6
      aut.

    Items
    -----
    * Axes have a cleaving attack: they hit up to seven targets with a single
      swing (all directions except directly opposite the direction of attack,
      but not if a wall is in the way). These secondary attacks do only 75%
      damage and do not hit allies. Base damage for the larger axes is
      reduced
      to compensate.
    * One-handed maces and flails have been improved: flails and eveningstars
    get
      a one point damage increase, and morningstars get a +3/-1
      damage/accuracy
      boost to replace spiked flails.
    * The wand of polymorph other is now the wand of polymorph; use of it
    against
      the player will turn them into a random form (including several new
      forms -
      tree form, wisp form, porcupine form and fungus form).
    * Scroll of unholy creation is replaced with scroll of summoning, which
      summons a few level-appropriate monsters.
    * Removed items: spiked flail, potion of water, staff of enchantment,
    plain
      (non-magic, non-quarter-) staves
    * Potion of decay rots HP immediately rather than giving the "Rot"
    status.
    * Potions and rings of levitation are now "of flight"; boots of
    levitation
      are now "of flying"; and the +Lev artefact property is now +Fly.
    * Amulet of controlled flight is removed; Amulet of the Air now grants
      passive Repel Missiles and inaccuracy instead.
    * Amulet of inaccuracy correctly affects ranged weapons.
    * Amulet of clarity prevents mesmerisation.
    * Some rods were changed to have a more focused spell set.
    * The "Contam" artefact property no longer causes contamination over
    time,
      but only when the item is unequipped.
    * The "*Rage" artefact property triggers much less often (except for
    Wrath of
      Trog).
    * Improved fixedarts: Spear of the Botono, Robe of Night, Cloak of the
    Thief,
      Robe of Folly, plutonium sword.
    * The hand-and-a-half weapon category is gone; such weapons are now
      one-handed for normal-size races.

    ----
    * Followers of worshippers of Beogh and Yredelemnul can now be recalled
    across
      levels.
    * Followers of Beoghites now share experience when the player scores
    kills.
    * Yredelemnul gives a small amount of piety for desecrating holy remains.

      skills.

      cost.

      monsters out of the way if possible.
    * Lugonu's Enter the Abyss no longer reduces maximum HP or MP.
    * Lugonu no longer gives piety for anything in the Abyss.
    * Mobile Fedhas-granted allies follow you across levels en masse.
    * New Xom effects: loud noises, blink monsters, enchant monster (petrify,
      slow, paralysis, enslavement; haste, might, invisibility), summon
      shadow
      creatures.
    * Xom does not reduce stats as drastically, unless bored.
    * Xom will not animate or swap weapons in the Abyss, and will not
    hostilely
      animate your weapon at all anymore.

      default.

    to
      "forbidden".

      out-of-range monster before falling back to the player's position,
      but will ignore plants.

    by
      prefixing it with "@".
    * Swap the cycle ammunition commands. '(' = backward, ')' = forward.
    * Webtiles supports real-time animations, toggleable via F10.
    * Webtiles displays miniature health and MP bars on the player.
    * Allies can now be ordered to retreat in a specific direction.

    Technical
    ---------
