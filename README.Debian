redeclipse for Debian
---------------------

debian/patches/01_makefile.patch:
 This is used simply to set a path which is guaranteed to work, the
 install process still copies from src/* because of the .install files
 used for menu items, this seems like something which could be done prettier.

TODO:
* Write manpage for server
* The ENet network library might be appropriate to split off to a separate
  package?
