Description: Open source clone of Theme Hospital
 As computers evolve, it is risked losing some
 classic games.
 Bullfrog's Theme Hospital, published in 1997, is a
 classic simulation game, but getting it to run
 natively on modern operating systems is getting
 progressively harder. 
 .
 This project aims to reimplement the game engine
 of Theme Hospital, and be able to load the original
 game data files. This means that you will need a
 purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the
 demo, in order to use CorsixTH. After most of the
 original engine has been reimplemented in open
 source code, the project will serve as a base from
 which extensions and improvements to the original
 game can be made.
