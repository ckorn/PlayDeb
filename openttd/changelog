    - Fix: The object GUI did not draw objects when all objects of a class

    - Fix: Inserting conditional orders for ships checked the wrong orders
    wrt. maximum distance (r23859)
    - Fix: Out of bounds read for slowdown parameter caused desync when
    railtype >= 4, vehicles were fast, and the original acceleration model
    was used [FS#5007] (r23855)
    - Fix: Infrastructure cache could get out of sync when overbuilding a
    drive through road stop (r23851)
    - Fix: When the network is lagging, you try to copy a vehicle's order but
    accidentally create a station order and then copy the vehicle's order
    (before the first command is executed) one could trigger an assertion
    from the pool [FS#5008] (r23849)
    - Fix: When removing road or tram from a tram+road stop, the owner of the
    road stop's cache was updated instead of the owner of the removed

    version check so a proper error can be given when a too old GRFCodec or
    NFORenum is used [FS#4867] (r23438)

    window [FS#4842] (r23429)
    - Fix: [NoAI] The AIEvent.ET_COMPANY_NEW was only triggered if a company
    named itself, which seems like a very odd place to do so. Trigger it when
    the company is created instead (r23398)
