    for short articulated parts following each other [FS#2553] (r24332)

    translation table (r24273)
    - Fix: [NewGRF] Load cargo- and railtype-translation during both
    reservation and activation stage. That way they can be selected using

    construction/destruction of houses, resulting in desyncs [FS#5169]

    houses when loading a game (r24182, r24181, r24179)

    GUI [FS#5110] (r24178)
    - Fix: The arctic 'shops and offices' used the 'church' sprite in one of
    its four views [FS#5148] (r24177)
    - Fix: The object GUI did not draw objects when all objects of a class
    are disabled (r24176)
    - Fix: If you spent hard work on finding an available object ID, you
    should probably also use it instead of always 0 (r24159)
    - Fix: Town producing no cargo at all could spawn passenger subsidies
    (r24158)

    [FS#5056] (r23927)

    access to the townzone (r23866)

    control the capacity for cargotypes which they know; and let cargo
    NewGRFs influence the capacity for cargos the vehicle NewGRF does not
    know, but which the vehicle is refittable to due to cargo classes
    (r23861)
    - Feature: [NewGRF] Add cargo property 1D to set the capacity multipliers
    when refitting vehicles, which do not use callback 15 (r23860)

    - Fix: [NoGo/NoAI] Scripts with a bad comparator could lock up OpenTTD

    was used [FS#5007] (r23855)

    drive through road stop (r23851)
    - Fix: When the network is lagging, you try to copy a vehicle's order but
    accidentally create a station order and then copy the vehicle's order
    (before the first command is executed) one could trigger an assertion
    from the pool [FS#5008] (r23849)
    - Fix: When removing road or tram from a tram+road stop, the owner of the
    road stop's cache was updated instead of the owner of the removed
    infrastructure (r23847)

    resulting in wrong noise levels or nearests towns [FS#4764] (r23441)

    cargo [FS#4820] (r23334)

    like when building rail, stations, etc [FS#4851] (r23331)
    - Fix: Change the centre of train vehicles to depend on the vehicle
    length instead of being fixed at 4/8th of the original vehicle length to
    make sure shortened vehicles do not block tiles they should not block
