    query window (r24293)
    - Fix: [NewGRF] GetReverseCargoTranslation() was unnecessary complicated
    and also returned the wrong thing for cargos not present in the
    translation table (r24273)
    - Fix: [NewGRF] Load cargo- and railtype-translation during both
    reservation and activation stage. That way they can be selected using

    other comparable windows (r24268)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Fix: Change the unit of the sprite-cache size setting from megabytes to
    megapixels, so it depends on the blitter being used. Also increase it

    probably also sync it to clients (r24193, r24191)
    - Fix: Use default value when reading an invalid setting value [FS#5153]
    (r24192, r24146)
    - Fix: [Windows] When going to fullscreen and back, restore to the
    resolution you were, not to the fullscreen resolution (r24189)
    - Fix: [Windows] When changing the basics of a window (fullscreen,
    8bpp/32bpp), and a window already exists, it was forced out of maximize

    construction/destruction of houses, resulting in desyncs [FS#5169]

    houses when loading a game (r24182, r24181, r24179)
    - Fix: The object name from property A was not displayed in the object
    GUI [FS#5110] (r24178)

    - Fix: The object GUI did not draw objects when all objects of a class

    - Fix: Do not look for missing sprites twice during startup [FS#5072]
    (r23963)

    [FS#5068] (r23962)
    - Fix: [NewGRF] Make the properties for always/never refittable cargo
    types not behave incremental, but reset them on reassignment (r23960)

    send them either (r23958)

    [FS#5056] (r23927)
    - Fix: [NoGo] Some news messages would cause an assertion to be triggered

    only allow building when valid data for the viewport is provided or no
    viewport is used [FS#5054] (r23924)
    - Fix: Consider only the middle tile of a lock for lock-infrastructure
    costs. The other two tiles may be owned by other companies. Also do not
    count the middle tile of a lock as canal, independent of whether it is
    build on ground or river slope (r23920)
    - Fix: [NewGRF] When determining the first refittable cargotype according
    to CTT order, do not rely on the GRF assigning the refit_mask property.

    cargoslots (r23914)

    access to the townzone (r23866)
    - Feature: [NewGRF] New algorithm (activated via an engine flag) to

    know, but which the vehicle is refittable to due to cargo classes
    (r23861)

    - Fix: [NoGo/NoAI] Scripts with a bad comparator could lock up OpenTTD

    - Fix: Make the colour of the dropdown items for opening the vehicle list
    for which the company has no vehicles looking less horrid [FS#5020]
    (r23867)
    - Fix: Railtype overlays were drawn 'only transparent' on invisible

    drive through road stop (r23851)
    - Fix: When the network is lagging, you try to copy a vehicle's order but

    (before the first command is executed) one could trigger an assertion
    from the pool [FS#5008] (r23849)
    - Fix: When removing road or tram from a tram+road stop, the owner of the
    road stop's cache was updated instead of the owner of the removed
    infrastructure (r23847)
    - Fix: Infrastructure count for stations was not updated properly on
    company takeover. And do not count buoys while loading a game either
    (r23844)
    - Fix: Clear NewGRF vehicle cache when their owner changes (r23841)
    - Fix: Assertion got hit when destroing a dock when a ship was loading

    - Fix: [NewGRF] While we can only show one error per NewGRF, fatal errors
    should always disable the GRF. Also give those errors precedence over
    other information (r23789)
    - Fix: [NewGRF] Failure to load newgrf files that use action 0 general
    prop 15 with a missing language file (r23788)

    - Fix: [Network] Missing naming of some errors[FS#4963] (r23780)
    - Fix: Trim all control codes and the likes from strings being passed

  * Explain why openttd is in contrib (Closes: #539381).

  * Fix the copyright file, since upstream only allows GPLv2, not later
    versions.
  * Add a section to the copyright file on the different license used by the
    "Squirrel" programming language, which is shipped with OpenTTD since
     0.7.0.
  * Backport upstream r17226, which removes the deprecated Encoding entry from

  * Add a wrapper script for openttd, which captures any stderr output and
    displays it when openttd returns an error code (Closes: #533557).
  * Recommend x11-utils, since we use xmessage for displaying errors. Don't
    depend on it, since openttd will still run fine without it, you just won't
    see any errors.
  * Backport upstream r17227 and r17229, which prevents terminal escape codes
    from ending up in the captured error output.
  * Backport upstream r17240, which improves stderr output when files are
    missing or corrupt.
