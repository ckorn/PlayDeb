mednafen (0.9.33.3-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    - Reworked the FPS calculation algorithm to produce more accurate FPS
    values.
    - Added a manifest file that's embedded into the Windows executable, to
    ensure that noxious DPI virtualization and scaling available on Windows
    Vista and newer will not be used with Mednafen.
    - Added code to disable DWM composition when running on pre-Windows 8
    systems, to ensure better performance and less video juddering.  (Sadly,
    it's not possible to disable desktop composition in this manner on
    Windows 8 and later)
    - PCE, PCE_FAST: Added a missing ADPCM playback variable to save states;
    fixes the problem of severe ADPCM sound distortion when loading save
    states that are saved during ADPCM playback(especially noticeable with
    the state rewinding feature).
    - Modified MDFN_RemoveControlChars() to not kill non-7-bit-ASCII text.
    - Misc minor code cleanups and fixes for some compiler warnings.
    - NES: Fixed broken emulation of board "UNL-Sachen-8259B"(used in the
    game "Silver Eagle").
    - Fixed the with-drop-shadow internal text drawing routine to not draw
    horizontally one pixel beyond the specified maximum width in some
    circumstances.
    - SNES: Altered a code construct to hopefully resolve a reported compiler
    error with clang.
    - Error out of save state loading when the version specified in the save
    state is invalid.
    - Call SDL_WM_SetIcon() before SDL_SetVideoMode(), to fix the problem of
    the missing Mednafen icon on some platforms/window managers.
    - Fixed a minor integer overflow issue in the core PSF loading code.
    - NES: Fixed some problems in the ROM image file loading code, including
    a potential heap overflow vulnerability.

  * New upstream version
    -PSX: Fixed a small MDEC emulation bug; fixes the hang during startup in
    "SimCity 2000".
    -The order of evaluation of the frame advance and run normal command
    keys/hotkeys is now based on whether or not we're currently in frame
    advance mode, to allow for the derivation of a single-press pause/unpause
    key(effected by the user mapping both functions to a single key).
    -Renamed the log2 LUT array in the mpcdec code to avoid shadowing the
    math library function log2().
    -NES: Fixed the problem of the VS Unisystem DIP switch position
    display(accessed via the "F6" key) being invisible.
    -PCE: Fixed broken MCGenjin support.
    -CDPLAY: Tweaked visualization code to reduce memory and CPU usage.
    -Lynx: Minor code cleanups.

mednafen (0.9.33.1-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    March 8, 2014:
    Fixed compiler errors when compiling without the debugger.

    Fixed a couple of memory leaks.

    PSX: Made better use of exceptions in the loading and initialization code
    paths(and avoid leaking memory if a part of the
    process fails).

    PSX: Protect against sound buffer overflow without causing a call to
    abort() so that using save states(when they're added)
    or power toggling/resetting in the debugger while in step mode is safer.

    PSX: Output of debug messages to stdout and stderr is now controlled via
    the "psx.dbg_level" setting, whose default
    value of "0" disables almost all debug messages.  Set the setting to "3"
    to obtain roughly the same output as previous
    versions of Mednafen.

    March 1, 2014:
    Modified the simple interpolation pixel shader code to avoid using the
    GLSL 1.3 function "round()", for better compatibility
    with some OpenGL implementations.

mednafen (0.9.26-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    -- 0.9.26-WIP: --

    October 13, 2012:
    PSX: Handle non-word-aligned timer port reads and writes, rather than
    triggering an assert().  Also, a warning message is
    now printed if a game tries to read from timer open bus space, rather
    than an assert() being triggered.

    More C++11 warning fixes.

    October 12, 2012:
    NES: Added emulation of iNES mapper 101.

    October 11, 2012:
    PSX: Added a "Dance Pad" emulated device, that uses mostly the same code
    as the "Gamepad" device, but doesn't provide
    access to the shoulder buttons, and allows for opposing D-pad directions
    to be pressed simultaneously.

    PSX: Improved emulation of bit15 of the SPU control register; fixes
    problems with "Dance Dance Revolution",
    "Medal of Honor", "Madden NFL 2003", "Fuuraiki", and "The Misadventures
    of Tron Bonne".

    October 10, 2012:
    PSX: Fixed a bug that could cause an emulator crash if the game crashed
    and tried to execute code in the last 64KiB of the
    CPU logical address space.

    -- 0.9.25-WIP: --

    October 9, 2012:
    Fixed a problem of usage of uninitialized memory in a startup function in
    drivers/input.cpp.

    October 8, 2012:
    PSX: Tweaked GunCon hit detection, to improve menu behavior in games like
    "Point Blank 2".

    PSX: Reduced the penalty time required to resume from a Pause state to
    the best-case observed times(for 1x and 2x) on a PS1;
    more accurate modeling will need to take into account the time passed
    since the Pause command among other things(TODO for
    the future maybe, though the relationship between time passed and time to
    resume from a Pause state is a bit...wonky).

    PSX: Pause command completion time is now more accurate, per tests on a
    PS1.

    October 7, 2012:
    PSX: Changed conditions under which "GetLocL" fails, per limited tests on
    a PS1.  Fixed a game-breaking lockup in "Star Ixiom".

    PSX: Added CDC "Standby" command and status emulation, fixes a
    game-breaking lockup in "Philosoma".

    October 6, 2012:
    PSX: Don't run DMA channel 1 unless there really is data available from
    the MDEC; fixes partially-broken FMV in "Rayman".

    October 5, 2012:
    PSX: DMA, and GPU FIFO emulation tweaks, to fix a regression in "Legacy
    of Kain - Soul Reaver"(the game does something fairly
    unique; it has a transfer length of 0x10 in some linked-list headers).

    PSX: Increased base cycle usage counts for polygon commands, per tests on
    a PS1.

    PSX: Improved GPU FIFO behavior, based on tests on a PS1.  The GPU on an
    actual PS1 appears(more of a hypothesis than anything, based
    on limited data) to have a contention or dependency system with different
    functional units that have access to the FIFO; the changes
    here just simulate some of its less-computationally-expensive
    characteristics in regards to GPU status bits and
    gross/rough timing.

    September 30, 2012:
    Fixed numerous code constructs that caused errors and/or warnings when
    compiling for the C++11 standard.

    September 29, 2012:
    PSX: Improved reliability of the Konami Justifier simulated offscreen
    shot process.

    PSX: More event handling tweaks.

    September 28, 2012:
    PSX: Added experimental emulation of the DREAD Konami Justifier.  This
    light gun makes tears of pain flow in a torrent.

    PSX: Added partial emulation of some esoteric timer features, though what
    was added is probably not totally correct.

    PSX: Altered the global event system to use a sorted doubly-linked list,
    to allow for more precise timing of events
    in relation of one sub-device/chip to another.

    September 27, 2012:
    Added code to allow CD image file data to be entirely loaded into memory,
    though the code is not used as such at current.

    SNES: Added boolean setting "snes.correct_aspect", default value of
    "0"(preserving previous behavior).

    PSX: Added additional heuristics for determining game region; fixes
    misdetection of the region for the North American release
    of "Wing Commander IV".

    September 25, 2012:
    PSX: Tweaked GunCon x coordinate scaling.

    Changed absolute mouse x and y coordinate passing from driver->core to be
    in 1.15.16 fixed point format(previously
    simple integers), to avoid excess precision loss when scaling the
    coordinates from viewport dimensions
    to nominal_width and nominal_height.

    September 24, 2012:
    PSX: Added preliminary GunCon emulation.

    Genesis: Adjusted aspect ratio slightly.

    PSX: Adjusted NTSC aspect ratio slightly.

    PSX: Reduced internal frame buffer width by 1/4(reduces memory usage).

    PSX: When playing a PSF, virtual input(gamepad, etc.) devices are no
    longer emulated as being connected.

    The CUE sheet reader will now seek past a UTF-8 BOM at the beginning of a
    CUE sheet if present(and print an error/warning
    message).

    Fixed resource leakage issue when CUE/TOC sheet loading aborts due to an
    error.

    September 20, 2012:
    Removed the rawer parts of a half-baked idea implemented long ago in the
    virtual input device abstraction structures, and
    removed some extremely poorly-scaling-with
    increased-emulated-system-count and emulated-device-count code that said
    half-baked functionality required, shaving a considerable amount off
    Mednafen's startup time
    (though probably not really noticeable on faster CPUs).

    Modified settings loading and saving code to use new FileStream
    functionality.

    September 18, 2012:
    Modified the CD image reading and "AudioReader" code(used for reading MS
    WAV/Vorbis/MusePack/etc) to operate on a
    "Stream" object instead of using stdio functions on "FILE", in regards to
    files used for track data.  This allows MemoryStream
    to be used very easily to preload the track file data into memory, which
    may be put to use in the future.

    Implemented FileStream, derived from Stream, as a quick wrapper around
    FileWrapper(HAH).

    September 15, 2012:
    Map SDL hats to buttons instead of axes in the new joystick interface
    abstraction code, to prevent loss of information.

    September 8, 2012:
    Entered more information into the possible values enum struct for the
    *.debugger.disfontsize setting(s) so that the possible values
    will be in the autogenerated documentation.

    September 7, 2012:
    Added a const char* "Description" member to the "InputDeviceInfoStruct",
    and did some minor internal plumbing so it will be propagated to the
    automatically-generated documentation if non-NULL.  (For the possibility
    of more verbose emulated input device information for the
    *.input.port* settings in the documentation)

    September 6, 2012:
    Increased size of line buffer used in settings file reading.

    Changed input configuration evaluation code to allow multiple physical
    mappings to a single emulated analog button/axis to work properly(it is
    somewhat useful for neGcon emulation).

    PSX: Added neGcon emulation.

    September 5, 2012:
    Added setting "input.joystick.global_focus".

    Renamed settings:
     autofirefreq -> input.autofirefreq
     analogthreshold -> input.joystick.axis_threshold
      ckdelay -> input.ckdelay

    September 3, 2012:
    PSX: Don't mask the address specified by the memcard write command, but
    instead signal an error condition if the address is invalid, per
    tests on a PS1.

    September 1, 2012:
    Reduced memory usage of internal runtime text rendering data structures
    by about 2.4MB for 64-bit builds, and about 0.8MB for 32-bit builds.

    August 31, 2012:
    Only destroy and recreate the emulated device and device state on the
    port being altered with CTRL+SHIFT+[n], rather than all ports, to
    avoid usability problems with more complex input devices(like on the PS1
    for instance).

    Fixed a longstanding bug that caused input configuration data to be lost
    if you changed the device on a port with CTRL+SHIFT+[n] after
    configuring input without an emulator exit in-between.

    August somethingth, 2012:
    PSX: Added DualShock emulation, complete with Analog mode toggle button
    emulation.

    Revamped physical joystick/gamepad support:
    Added native code targeting DirectInput(5.0) and XInput on MS Windows,
    and jsdev and evdev on Linux.

    Added support for rumble on Linux and XInput devices on MS Windows.

    Refactored and recoded much of the joystick input configuration handling
    code.

    Added kludgey support for handling physical joystick analog buttons in
    the input configuration process without it freaking out:
      Note: The process described below should NOT be necessary if you're
      using an XBox 360/XInput controller under MS Windows.  If
      you're using such a controller under a different operating system, or
      using a non-XBox 360/non-XInput controller, and it has
      analog buttons, then you should perform the process as described below.

      Also note that the process is only necessary when you're configuring
      inputs, and not during "normal" gameplay/usage.

      Twirl all sticks and D-pads and press all analog buttons on any
      physical gamepads/joysticks with analog buttons you want
      to use in the input configuration process, then press F3.  Then,
      configure input as normal.  The detected analog buttons
      will be recognized during input configuration until Mednafen exits;  if
      you exit Mednafen and restart, and want to configure
      input devices again, you'll need to repeat the twirling-pressing-F3
      process again).

    August 12, 2012:
    Fixed a bug that was causing the FPS display to be missing if the
    "overlay" video driver was used in combination with PC Engine emulation.

    Removed the last vestiges of the driver-side handling of the long since
    removed/replaced PC-FX multi-resolution-frame multi-layer alpha
    blending method.

    August 11, 2012:
    Added setting "osd.alpha_blend", default value of "1", that controls
    enabling of OSD alpha-channel blending.  Set it to "0" for
    a speedup when using the "sdl" video.driver.

    Software("sdl" video driver) render fixes/improvements:
    Improved precision and rounding behavior with the fixed-point math used
    for scanline effects and non-integer scaling.

    Implemented alpha blending for all OSD elements except the FPS display.

    Added support for the scanlines effect when the screen is rotated(via
    ALT+O).

    Fixed a bug that caused an enabled scanline effect to be missing when a
    special scaler(hq2x, hq3x, scale2x, etc) is used
    and no post-special-scaler scaling is necessary.

    August 10, 2012:
    Implemented minor optimizations to the "sdl" "video.driver" scanlines
    effect code.

    Changed a ton of driver-side OSD rendering code to use MDFN_Surface
    instead of SDL_Surface.

    August 1, 2012:
    Fixed port numbering(from 0-based to 1-based) in the error message
    display after trying to configure buttons for a nonexistent virtual
    device/port.

    June 14, 2012:
    Added a non-threaded alternative implementation of CDIF(currently unused,
    but will be useful if we ever target an OS without multithreading
    capabilities).

    July 13, 2012:
    Lynx: Made reporting of errors during game load to be more verbose.

    GB: Error out if a ROM image to be loaded is less than 512 bytes in size.

    GB: Don't use TestMagic() in Load(), and don't return -1.  (So that
    -force_module gb will work as expected)

mednafen (0.9.24-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    July 12, 2012:
    Only use "AI_ADDRCONFIG" flag with getaddrinfo() hints if it's available;
    fixes a compilation error on OpenBSD.

    Disallow manual save states with "snes" module during netplay, since the
    bsnes save state code alters the current state on save state,
    which would cause desynchs, or annoyances and extra bandwidth usage to
    work around the issue, in a netplay environment.

    July 9, 2012:
    Netplay:
    Removed setting "netplay.merge", since similar functionality can be
    obtained by issuing one or more of the newly-added commands.

    Added /take, /dupe, and /drop commands.

    July 8, 2012:
    PSX: Implemented CD-XA playback current file and channel matching(per
    very limited tests on a real PS1), fixes broken speech in
    "Yarudora Series Vol.1 - Double Cast".

    Netplay:
    BSD/POSIX: Only use MSG_NOSIGNAL if it is defined; fixes compilation
    issue on Mac OS X.  And don't use MSG_NOSIGNAL
    for recv(), only send().

    BSD/POSIX: Use socket option "SO_NOSIGPIPE", if available.

    Handle a recv() return value of zero properly(or at least semi-properly
    :b), to prevent a lockup in certain situations.

    Added player /swap command(requires mednafen-server 0.5.0).

    July 6, 2012:
    SMS: Added "Power Strike II" to the internal game database, to force PAL
    mode, per suggestion from "megadriver".
