redeclipse for Debian
---------------------

Debugging:
 If the redeclipse engine crashes on your system, please install the
 redeclipse-dbg package to generate a backtrace of the crash.
 To generate a backtrace open a terminal and change to the directory
 /usr/lib/games/redeclipse using the command "cd /usr/lib/games/redeclipse".
 Then run "gdb ./redeclipse" and type "run -r -df0" at the gdb prompt.
 Once redeclipse has crashed, type "bt" to obtain the backtrace. Please attach
 the output when you are reporting a bug about crashes.
